  weekend started with a trip to the Conestoga Mall, to spend some of my hard earned
  L3wt.  I ended up with some new shirts and underwear (exciting!) a belt, some books,
  and finally, some real alcohol. (Strongbow, Canadian Club, Polar Ice, and some wine
  for my sauce)\n\nHO! WAIT! I heard your disapproving nod. \"More books? How will
  you ever transport those home?\". I'm sure I'll find room. I'm addicted to purchasing
  books. I picked up <a title=\"The Rebel Sell\" href=\"http://rebelsell.squarespace.com/\">The
  Rebel Sell</a>, <a title=\"The Singularity Is Near\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Singularity-Near-Humans-Transcend-Biology/dp/0670033847\">
  The Singularity Is Near</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Ancestors-Tale-Pilgrimage-Dawn-Evolution/dp/061861916X/ref=sr_1_6/105-4352976-7099609?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1190652447&sr=1-6\">The
  Ancestors Tale </a>.\n\nIf \"The Rebel Sell\" doesn't improve really soon, it's
  staying in Waterloo. Although I approve of debunking Freudian theology (er.. psychology)
  as much as the next guy, it spends way too long making the same points again and
  again. \n\nAs for \"The Singularity Is Near\", well, it's more of Ray Kurzweil's
  super-incredibly-optimistic-future-predictions. I read \"The Age Of Spiritual Machines\"
  predicting strong AI by 2010, and I'm still waiting for some damn strong AI. While
  the predictions might be a bit overly optimistic, though, it still makes for an
  entertaining read. Woo future!\n\nFinally, I heart the Richard Dawkins.  Sometimes
  the evolutionary reading can be a bit slow, but it's good to better understand the
  theory that I defend. (It certainly beats the other theories, which inconveniently
  require an external 'guiding' entity to exist.) \n\nAlso, the belt was a lifesaver.
  \ Nothing says 'confidence' like not constantly having to pull your pants up to
  their proper level.\n\nDuring the shopping trip, I started to organize a sushi expedition
  with my roommates.  I wanted to eat some sushi- maybe even some all-you-can-eat
  sushi.  I'm a big fan of sushi. I've even written an article on <a title=\"The worst
  possible way to eat sushi\" href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=241\">the worst
  possible way to eat sushi.</a>\n\nWhen I arrived at home, we all gathered as a group
  (all 4 of us- me, Mike, Tim, and Ben), and started walking towards the sushi restaurant.
  \ We just barely missed the bus, so we walked a couple of kilometres into town instead,
  hungry all the while.  When we finally arrived at the sushi restaurant, it looked
  strangely empty.  Eventually, one of us discovered the enormous sign in front of
  the Sushi restaurant. \"Grand Opening: Sept 29\". Nuts.  \n\nThere was still hope,
  however- Ben knew of another all-you-can-eat sushi place in the area.  We walked
  another kilometre or two to arrive at a little sushi restaurant with a bright \"OPEN\"
  sign outside. JOYOUSNESS!\n\nWe roamed inside, only to be told that the sushi restaurant
  wouldn't be seating anybody.  They were running out of sushi rice, and didn't have
  enough food to feed 4 large, hungry-looking students.  We determined that our score
  for the sushi run was zero, and started hunting for alternate forms of food.\n\nOf
  the four of us, only two wanted to go to some alternative 'decent' restaurant, like
  The Keg or Kelsey's.  Mike and Ben voted for fast food, instead, and we ended up
  caving and going for the cheaper option. (Also, we were super hungry).\n\nWe raided
  a local Wendy's- quite possibly the only Wendy's in Waterloo.  It looked just like
  the Wendy's that I remember from Langley- understaffed, dirty, and empty save for
  a few seniors.  How do they stay in business?  \n\nThen, I went to the local Future
  Shop to buy the game Warcraft 3.  Normally, I wouldn't buy (or PLAY) video games-
  I have other things that I like to do.  The thing is, though, that everybody in
  my house- all of my roommates- play DOTA (A Warcraft 3 offshoot) constantly.  If
  I want in on the action, I have to own a copy of the game so that I can join them
  on Battle.net and play ridiculously low-ping (fast, because we live in the same
  house) games while bellowing obscenities at Tim. (Okay, I bellow obscenities at
  Tim even if I'm not playing DOTA.)\n\nMike invited a friend over, and we spent the
  rest of the night playing DOTA.  As I enumerated in an earlier post, <a title+\"Nobody
  Wants To Hear You Talk About Gaming\" href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=228\">
  talking about gaming makes for terrible conversation</a>, so I'll just say one thing:
  I heart Goblin Techies. BOOM. \n\nSunday was sauce-day. Usually, it's laundry-day,
  but I had to move laundry-day to make room for sauce-day. (Laundry takes me a long
  time because I keep forgetting that it even exists). The sauce that I made contained
  everything under the sun, including most of my leftovers.  Carrots, onions, celery,
  a bag of spinach, mushrooms, fresh oregano, fresh parsley, fresh thyme, fresh sage,
  fresh basil, two heads of roasted garlic, a Serrano pepper, a marinating steak (cut
  into strips and seared), about 20 roasted tomatoes, 2 cans of plum tomatoes, 2 cans
  of tomato paste, a litre of my last tomato sauce, a bottle of Jackson-Triggs Cabernet
  Sauvignon, some spicy beef from the last time I made burritos, miscellaneous spices,
  sugar, and a whole Polka Band. (\"You Polka Her Good\")\n\nThe whole process started
  cookin' around 5:00PM in my huge cheap stock-pot.. and the sauce didn't achieve
  the thick, delicious consistency of my dreams until about 2:00 AM the next morning-
  partially because I kept it at a low, low simmer the entire time (Cheap pots will
  burn sauces very easily, at least according to my Uncle).  I spooned out a bit of
  the sauce at midnight to make dinner, and it was good- but still not quite thick
  enough- I had to sop up some juice with a calabrese roll. (Mmm.)\n\nPutting the
  whole thing into containers afterwards, I ended up with about 7 litres of sauce.
  I'll be eating THAT for a while (or giving it away, or using it in my next sauce,
  or putting it in balloons and throwing it at people in suits, or whatever..).\n\nOf
  course, now it's the next day and I spent the entire morning wishing for a sweet
  and swift death.  Caffeine has made that problem less apparent, and I'm happily
  coding away. Huzzah!\n"
