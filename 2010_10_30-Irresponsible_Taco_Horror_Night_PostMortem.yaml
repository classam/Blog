  are very difficult to make, especially if you use two cans of pumpkin instead of
  one, and do not have a strainer. </li> \n<li> Margaritas, made according to the
  Alton Brown <a href=\"http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/margarita-recipe/index.html\">margarita
  recipe</a> - video <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qktkhDlqK8k&feature=related\">here
  </a> - are the <em>most delicious alcoholic drink I've ever encountered. </em> </li>
  \n<li> I could seriously use the following kitchen equipment: \n <ul>\n  <li> cocktail
  glasses </li>\n  <li> strainer / bar strainer </li> \n  <li> manual juicer </li>\n
  </ul>\n</li> \n<li> Like any good software developer, if you give <a href=\"http://travisbrown.ca/blog.html\">Travis
  Brown </a>a recipe, he will interpret the hell out of it, and it will come out delicious.
  </li> \n<li> Agave Nectar is expensive.  It would probably be more beneficial for
  me to make a batch of good cheap simple syrup and put it in a 50-cent squeeze bottle.
  </li> \n<li> Good tequila and good triple sec is expensive. No way to get around
  that. </li> \n</ul>\n\n<h2> Taco </h2>\n<ul> \n <li> Hard taco shells (I haven't
  used them in years) need to be baked a little to get to 'crisp-land'. </li> \n <li>
  When shopping for soft tacos, look for corn. Corn/flour mix tortillas are pretty
  good. </li> \n  <li> Make your own taco powder.  People will ask you about it, and
  then you can feel all smug when they do. Mine is composed of: <ul> \n<li> Chili
  powder </li>\n<li> Cumin powder </li>\n<li> Toasted cumin seeds </li> \n<li> Smoked
  paprika </li>\n<li> Onion powder </li>\n<li> Garlic powder </li>\n<li> Corn stach
  </li> \n<li> Salt </li> \n</ul>\nThen mixed with chipotles in adobo sauce, tomato
  paste, and broth.  <em> I used too much salt, but thanks to the fact that every
  taco was well-topped, it wasn't too much of a problem. </em>\n</li>\n <li> 3/4 kilo
  of meat and 1 can of refried beans is just enough for 7 people.  An eighth person
  will get WEE TACOS, especially if he shows up late. </li> \n</ul> \n\n<h2> Horror
  (Arkham Horror) </h2>\n<ul> \n  <li> Beginner's luck is a surprisingly powerful
  force.  In many cases where something <em>very bad</em> could have happened, it
  didn't, because someone rolled a lucky six. Oh, and there were two <a href=\"http://www.arkhamhorrorwiki.com/Elder_sign\">elder
  signs</a> in the <em>starting equipment</em>. </li>\n  <li> Keeping all of the parts
  in separate tubs, and all of the cards in pre-divided elastic bands, made set-up
  and take-down very easy. However, I still needed to run a separate 'game management
  table' with all of our parts on it. </li> \n  <li> I made a 'cheat sheet' containing
  a bunch of things about the game that I might forget - monster types, game order,
  and what-have-you- but it turns out that the instruction manual has a helpful cheat
  sheet on the back. So that was unnecessary.</li> \n   <li> Arkham Horror is <em>fun
  times</em>, and we'll likely play it again. </li> \n</ul> "
