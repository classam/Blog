  an earlier post from user <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/jump_the_next_train/\">jump_the_next_train</a>:\n\n<blockquote>\nHello,\n\nI
  have spent the last few years reading almost all of the works of the following authors:\n\n
  \  1. Philip K. Dick\n   2. Kurt Vonnegut\n   3. Isaac Asimov\n   4. Orson Scott
  Card\n   5. Frank Herbert\n   6. Robert Heinlein (not too fond of his work)\n   7.
  Poul Anderson (not too fond either)\n   8. Arthur C Clark\n   9. Douglas Adams\n
  \ 10. William Gibson (read a couple of books)\n\nCan you guys recommend any other
  sci-fi authors? I have started with some Bruce Sterling, but I am rapidly running
  out of options at the half-price bookstore, and need some new material. Your help
  is greatly appreciated-please upmod any recommended authors..i particularly like
  Philip K Dick (is that considered cliche now?), anything similar would be best-
  but I am willing to experiment. Cheers, reddit!\n</blockquote>\n\nAnd here's a most-recent
  quote:\n\n<blockquote>\nyeah, the fucking thing sucks. he should have done it live.\n</blockquote>"
