  awesome gypsy-jazz remix of the Super Mario Bros. 2 theme</a>. \n\nI surf around
  on the website a bit, and I discover that Adrian Holovaty, the composer, was also
  a major contributor to the Django project.   Pretty sneaky, sis. I suppose it only
  makes sense that people with a musical background would name a web framework after
  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt\">Django Reinhardt</a>.
  \n\nCreative, intelligent people are everywhere.  I'm not sure how we're going to
  stop them, but I suggest that the answer may be more television. \n\n\n"
