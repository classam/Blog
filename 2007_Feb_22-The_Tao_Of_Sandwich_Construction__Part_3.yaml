  Meats: The Metaphorical Meat Of Your Metaphorical Sandwich

  Oh, meat. Meat, meat, meat.  Meat is the very foundation of your sandwich, the lodestone
  keeping all of the other pieces in check.  Your meat must be deli-fresh and there
  are many considerations when choosing and sandwiching your meat.  Let''s start by
  looking at the different types of meat.


  <strong>Pig</strong>

  Ah, the stately pig. The "Magic" animal from which the great wellsprings of both
  ham and bacon flow. Truly a champion amongst meats, most varieties of ham are delicious
  additions to any sandwich- and bacon is welcome even with other non-pig meats!

  Of course, just calling ham ''ham'' is not giving it enough credit. Even at your
  deli you can find any number of different varieties of ham, and for sandwich-construction
  purposes you''ll find many more.


  <strong>Black Forest Ham</strong>

  Traditional Black Forest Ham (Schwarzwalder Schinken) is a variety of smoked ham
  produced in the Black Forest region of Germany.  Ham is salted and seasoned with
  garlic, coriander, pepper, juniper berries and assorted other spices, then cured.  Unless
  you travel to Europe, however, you''re likely not to encounter actual Black Forest
  Ham (Which, like "Champagne", is geographically protected in Europe and can only
  come from the Black Forest). What you''ll encounter over here is a knockoff of the
  European ham, not held to the same quality standards. Don''t worry too much about
  it, though- at any deli here, the black forest ham that you''ll sample is likely
  to be delicious nonetheless.


  <strong>Honey Ham</strong>

  Honey ham, quite obviously, is ham that has had honey used as a sweetening agent
  in it''s production.  Really, all you need to know about Honey Ham is that it''s
  delicious and sweeter than most variants of ham.

  <strong>

  Baked Ham</strong>

  Now, some ham you won''t be able to find behind the deli counter. Often as a celebratory
  food (Like turkey, or a roast), your family may prepare a baked ham. If they do,
  count your lucky stars- after a baked ham has been prepared, you will enjoy a temporary
  boost in your Sandwich Tao, as baked ham is possibly one of the most delicious things
  you can prepare a sandwich from. If your family is prone to glazing things, perhaps
  even with honey, try to get outer (''glazed'') pieces for your sandwich, as they
  are doubly delicious.


  <strong>Bacon</strong>

  Bacon truly embodies the Sandwich Tao: It is delicious and terrible for you.  Very
  few things embody the glee of conspicuous sandwich consumption as bacon does.  Preparing
  bacon for your sandwich can be a difficult task, however- if the bacon is too soggy,
  your sandwich will come out chewy and unattractive, whereas if the bacon is too
  crisp your sandwich will crackle unpleasantly with every bite.  Proper bacon preparation
  is a difficult practice, and I highly recommend you practice it at home until you
  have mastery of bacon. The perfect bacon is lightly browned and crisp enough to
  break off when you take a bite out of it, without offering too much resistance.  You
  should actually take the bacon out of the pan a little while before it reaches this
  stage, though- it''ll continue to cook even after it''s out of the pan, and if you''re
  keeping it warm in an oven, it''ll grow crunchier still.

  Remember: Bacon is a privelige, not a right.


  <strong>Prosciutto</strong>

  It''s Italian! It''s dry-cured! It has a very distinctive taste that''s difficult
  to describe! It commonly makes an addition to Caprese Salad (which is also delicious)
  and rarely makes an addition to Canadian sandwiches, although it''s worth a try,
  cooked or uncooked.


  <strong>Spam</strong>

  Oh, you just turned up your nose, there, didn''t you. You turned your nose up at
  Spam because you don''t know what goes into it, or because you do know what goes
  into it. (In goes a pig. Out comes meat. No remainder.)  Well, you know what? The
  First Nations peoples to frequent this land before us were proud to use every last
  bit of the meat, and so should you be.  Spam, or "SPiced hAM", is actually a cornerstone
  piece of a pretty delicious sandwich.  SPAM is very much like the hamburger of Pork
  meats. (Oh, yeah, you think Spam is disgusting, wait''ll you see how hamburgers
  are made.) It''s cheap and salty and definitely worth a shot for the student seeking
  inexpensive protein or delicious sandwiches.


  <strong>Bologna</strong>

  Referred to as "Newfie Steak", bologna is a derivative of pork, and a variant on
  the Italian mortadella. (Minced pork with lard) Bologna omits the large bits of
  porkfat, however, making it a <em>slightly </em>leaner alternative (Many forms of
  mortadella are over 40% fat). Deli bologna is almost always preferable to packaged
  bologna, usually being less salty and watery. Bologna has a rather distinctive flavor
  and usually needs to be paired with a soft, tasteless cheese to offset the ''bolognaness''
  of the sandwich.


  <strong>Capicollo</strong>

  The meat of a thousand spellings, capicollo is cured, then cooked.  Capicollo is
  spicy, expensive, and usually served in thin slices. If you''re prepared to shell
  out some dough, capicollo is a nice treat.


  <strong>Pork Sausage</strong>

  So, you made yourself some sausages last night for dinner. Johnsonville Brats, perhaps?
  Spicy italian sausages? Heck, even breakfast sausages are nice.  Slice ''em up into
  sandwich-sized bites (the way you would a banana) and toss ''em on. Trust me, it''s
  good.


  <strong>Landjager, Pepperoni</strong>

  Okay, I''m not going to warn you away from many pork products- they''re all good
  (Except maybe bologna) but dried meats, like Landjager (pork and beef) or Beef Jerky
  (beef) do not belong in your sandwich.  Keep them away.  The only exception to this
  would be pepperoni, which, while inappropriate in it''s sticklike munchable form,
  can be a formidable sandwich addition in it''s wetter pre-pizza state. (i.e., dry
  pepperoni: bad. wet pepperoni: good.)


  <strong>What goes well with piggly products?</strong>

  So, you''ve got a ham-based sandwich, now, hm?

  Well, what else should you put on it?

  Mustard.  That''s a given.  Ham and mustard are old pals from college. A good cheese
  is another fine option for your ham sandwich- so much that the ''ham and cheese''
  sandwich is almost a ubiquitous choice.  So you''ve got ham, cheese, and mustard.  Toss
  on some lettuce and tomato, some salt and pepper, and some nice bread, and you have
  yourself a sandwich. Tao''d!'
