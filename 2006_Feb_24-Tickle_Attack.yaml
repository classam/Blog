  This is the last comic that I sent to The Peak.


  I''m not going to lie, Kristen had a hand in making it too, being that she all but
  came up with the joke.Â  We were sitting together, and I was doodling on a pad of
  paper, as is customary. She nabbed the page from me, scribbled a note on it, and
  handed it back to me. "You have been warned. TICKLE ATTACK!"


  Sadly, the warning did not suffice.'
