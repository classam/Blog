  well as the correct name of the restaurant, \"Taste Nice\". Silly me! </i>\n\nA
  few days ago, me and <a href=\"http://lonegamer.wordpress.com/\">Ryan</a> were getting
  a ride to the bus station from <a href=\"http://ah61.com/\">Phil</a>. \n\nOn the
  way, he asked if we were hungry and suggested a nearby Jamaican place.\n\nI was
  snorgbaffled. Jamaican food? I had experienced some Caribbean food before, once,
  but it was in a strange little cafe in North Vancouver and the thing I had (A sort
  of spicy avocado eggs benedict) seemed more like a once-off concoction than some
  sort of traditional food. \n\nOkay, I wasn't that hungry, but I volunteered, and
  cajoled Ryan into it, too.  Who would miss an opportunity to try something new?
  \n\nPhil took us to a little hole-in-the-wall called \"Taste Nice\" just next to
  Gateway Station in Surrey.  Now, I'll say this right now- I have nothing but respect
  for this sort of restaurant. Nothing compares to little family-owned joints with
  fresh, authentic home-cookin'.  Apparently, the proprietors of this restaurant are
  also pretty close to Phil.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, I was immediately confused.
  There weren't many tables or chairs. Maybe it was it a take-out restaurant?  Nothing
  on the menu-board seemed like it would be a portable item, but why else would there
  be so few tables and chairs?  Maybe they were just cleaning up for the day when
  we arrived- or maybe the menu really is a more casual take-out kind of fare. (Phil?)\n\nSome
  unidentifiable reggae music was playing- I can differentiate 86 individual types
  of electronic music, from Trance to Electroclash, but to me, reggae always falls
  into the fairly large and faceless category of \"music that is far too slow to concentrate
  on\". \n\nPhil just blazed in to the kitchen, greeting everybody.  An older fellow
  came out and started bantering back and forth with Phil in a thick, unintelligible
  <a title=\"Wikipedia; Jamaican Patois\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaican_Patois\">Jamaican
  Patois</a>.  I'm sure they started by talking about the music- how it was a remix
  and something something, but everything after that just faded into a blur of sylabbles
  with the occasional English sounding word.\n\nHe turned to Ryan and me, dialed down
  his accent a bit, and explained a few things about his restaurant- his simple home-cooked
  philosophy, and how \"Taste Nice\" was his attempt at truth in advertising.\n\nWe
  ordered beef patties and drinks- Ryan had a Cream Soda and I tried a excessively
  refreshing citrus drink called \"<a title=\"Wikipedia: Ting\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ting_%28soft_drink%29\">Ting</a>\".
  \ The patties were mildly spiced beef surrounded in a slightly-greasy home-made
  pastry- I liked them, and I'll have to go back for a  more substantial meal at some
  point.  I don't know what to order, though. ( Phil? )\n\nThen a younger guy came
  out- the proprietor's son, perhaps?  He had a bit of Comp-Sci education and talked
  shop with us for a bit.   While a patois may leave me high and dry, I'm sure nerd
  jargon can be an impenetrable mass to digest for outsiders, too. \n\nSo.. Taste
  Nice tasted good, awaiting further scrutiny.  And I'm going to have to find some
  sort of local Ting supplier to satisfy my newfound grapefruit-drink cravings. "
