  My history teacher, he hands out .. handouts! And he doesn''t have a website!

  I mean, honestly, I didn''t know *what* to think.

  I''ve lost every handout he''s given out to date.

  Well, this one is really, really important, and I''m not going to lose it.

  So I scanned it into my computer, and now it''s on the internet.


  Oh- and that due date, it''s August 14th, not August 4th, else I''d be proper fucked.'
