  <em>Hostility towards Microsoft is not difficult to find on the Net, and it blends
  two strains: resentful people who feel Microsoft is too powerful, and disdainful
  people who think it''s tacky. This is all strongly reminiscent of the heyday of
  Communism and Socialism, when the bourgeoisie were hated from both ends: by the
  proles, because they had all the money, and by the intelligentsia, because of their
  tendency to spend it on lawn ornaments. Microsoft is the very embodiment of modern
  high-tech prosperity--it is, in a word, bourgeois--and so it attracts all of the
  same gripes.</em>'
