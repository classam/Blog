  sat down and started to talk about what he wanted to do with his site- Eventually,
  we worked out that he wanted to write about his experiences as a chef and his thoughts
  on food and nutrition, slowly build an audience, and then potentially sell some
  restaurant-planning services. I suggested that instead of building the entire infrastructure,
  we just build a blog to try to feel-out what he'd be writing, how often, and how
  we should structure the site in the future. \n\nFrom there, I started working with
  the 'fresh, simple food' theme that he gave me, and put together a few quick sample
  themes in Photoshop.  At the time, I was strongly concentrating on designs that
  were thin - thin designs fit in even the smallest monitors- so I concentrated on
  delivering the entire experience in less than 770 pixels. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/images/antoniodesign/picnic%20800x600.png\">Picnic</a>\n<a

  Parsley</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/images/antoniodesign/curry-1024x768.png\">Curry</a>\n\nLooking
  back on these designs, I'm actually a bit embarassed about how unpolished they were.
  \n\nWe eventually decided to work with the \"Italian Parsley\" theme.  The actual
  construction of the site was very quick- I built the whole thing as a theme for
  Wordpress, and hosted it with <a href=\"http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?216909\">Dreamhost</a>.
  \ It tested well in Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox, and only took a couple of days.
  \ I installed Google Analytics and the Akismet spam-blocker on the site.\n\nUpon
  delivery of the final product, I gave my uncle a quick run-through on how to use
  Wordpress, guiding him through the process of logging in, posting an article, editing
  an article, and checking his site analytics. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.chownow.ca/blog/\">Here's
  the site</a>.  While my uncle was happy with the final product, he started working
  on a new restaurant project a good week after the blog was completed, and hasn't
  posted a single thing on the blog to date.  After a couple of e-mails asking whether
  he was having trouble with the site or the software, I concluded that he was just
  too busy to write anything. Ah, well.   "
