content: ! "I just finished \"Spook Country\", by William Gibson\n\nThis is the first
  book I've read by him, despite his fame.  (Yes, yes, that also means I've never
  read 'Neuromancer'.)  \n\nIntelligence is played up, often, as being exciting James-Bond
  style work.  This is, of course, a complete falsehood.  For most intelligence agents,
  one would imagine, the business involves a great deal more sitting around in coffee
  shops, listening to inane conversations and filing massive amounts of convoluted
  paperwork.\n\nAnd Spook Country certainly captures the feeling of sitting in a coffee
  shop, desperately waiting for something interesting to happen.  The book takes the
  common formula of slowly dropping hints that something big is going down, building
  a puzzle of overlapping narratives that - by the end of the book- manage to intertwine
  and make sense. \n\nAnd - here I'm warning you that there may be <strong>spoilers</strong>
  - I didn't like it that much.\n\nThe story follows three characters - Brown, a stuck-up,
  over-officious American Homeland Security type, The Old Man, a crisply dressed old
  'spook' of some sort, with connections in seemingly innumerable places, and Hubertus
  Bigend, a big-business interest. \n\nOf course, following these players and their
  internal monologues directly would result in the entire book finishing up and closing
  shop in a few pages, so clearly some mooks needed to be introduced to tail each
  of the big players, clumsily stumbling into the book's plot whenever possible.  \n\nThe
  underlying plot, once it's eventually uncovered, is none-too-convoluted.  The whole
  thing is an elaborate sham being pulled over the eyes of Brown & Co., executed by
  The Old Man.  As for Hubertus, for whom is reserved a full third of the book, he
  was just a curious external interest.  At the end of the story, despite the fact
  that his 'agent' (mook) was present at the climax and denouement, he seems to lose
  interest in the story entirely and drift on to other things.  I don't blame him.
  \ \n\nThe narrative follows three characters- Hollis Henry, Tito, and Milgrim, each
  of them a <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson\">Watson</a>
  - following along in the path of their associated players- Hollis Henry with Bigend,
  Tito with the Old Man, and Milgrim with Brown, respectively.  Each one of them has
  their clothes pressed and their schedules made, following all-but on-the-rails paths
  set out for them by their respective employers.  \n\nTito is talented at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour\">Parkour</a>
  , Milgrim at deciphering <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volapuk\">Russan
  text-messages</a>, and Hollis Henry is famous for being an ex-rockstar.  Were it
  not for these skills - of narrow use to each one - each character could just-as-well
  have been replaced by a trash can or a box of cabbages, wheeled about to various
  locations to have thin bits of storyline squeezed into them before being wheeled
  to yet another destination. \n\nIf you're looking to avoid <strong>spoilers, they
  end here. </strong> \n\nThe reason that it's so popular in Vancouver is the same
  reason that jPod was so popular- regardless of the content, much of the book's action
  takes place in Vancouver, and we are willing to all-but-shit-ourselves with locational
  pride whenever we see mention of a local feature in an actual real-person novel.
  \ Commercial Drive? WOO YEAH THAT'S A PLACE THAT I'VE BEEN.  Sarah Ferguson?  WOO
  YEAH I KNOW A PERSON WITH THAT NAME.\n\nAnd, don't confuse my criticism with genuine
  hatred- I said that \"I didn't like it that much\", not that \"I didn't like it.\"\n\nThe
  Vancouver setting, had me, in it's own manipulative little way.  I crave references
  to the place where I live in popular culture.  I just can't get enough of them-
  and William Gibson, a Vancouver native, seemed to hit all of the notes - in the
  same way that jPod, being vaguely about Electronic Arts ( a place where I've worked
  ) and much of the TV show being filmed at SFU ( the place where I go to school )
  - well, there's a feeling of validation in having your experience made a part of
  the media.  It's the same sense of pride I got when a picture of Vancouver was front-paged
  on reddit. \n\nThe occasional references - to darknets, public-key cryptography,
  freerunning, GPS tracking, and the like - are interesting, at least.\n\nThe book
  also presents a concept called 'locative art' which seems misguided - using virtual
  reality helmets, GPS devices, and public Wi-Fi to attach art to specific locations?
  \ The whole concept is sort of loosely-grafted on to the plot. It doesn't really
  have any meaning, storywise, seems a lot more like the author wanted to point at
  an idea of his and go 'hey, look at how neat this thing is!'.  It's really nothing
  more than a sort of reverse geotagging, though.  It seems fairly obvious to me that,
  with ubiquitous GPS equipment will come people who tag all sorts of coordinates
  around them with interesting metadata- which can then be browsed by other people
  in the same area- at least, people that you're following.  Like a great giant locational
  Twitter. (\"Curtis Says: Eat here. It's delicious. Order the Pho\" on a restaurant,
  or \"Benton Says: I saw a homeless man pooping here\" next to a bus stop.)   Honestly,
  if people aren't already doing this with the iPhone... I might very well get myself
  an iPhone and a developer account and go to town on this baby.  It seems way too
  obvious, though. \n\nAs for the VR helmets, well, the proof is in the pudding. I've
  been waiting 22 years for someone to successfully mass-market one, and I'll probably
  be waiting a few more, at least.  Maybe OLED technology has an answer for us? \n\nI'd
  file the book firmly into the 'borrow or ignore' category.  "
