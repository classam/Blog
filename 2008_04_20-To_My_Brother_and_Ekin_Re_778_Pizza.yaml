content: ! "Well, I'm sure you're getting tonnes of unsolicited advice from people
  who wish that they were opening a pizza restaurant- so... here's some more.\n\nEverybody
  I show my <a href=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/images/778logo.pdf\">'778 Pizza' logo
  design</a> to just seems a little disappointed.\n\nI spend more time trying to get
  the name across than I do introducing the logo.\n\n\"778 pizza? What the hell does
  that mean\"\n\"That's a stupid name\"\n\nAt least 10 people have commented about
  how terrible the name is.\n\nHave you thought of maybe doing a little bit of market
  research? Brainstorm about 15 different pizza names (including '778 pizza'), maybe
  with some quick logos, and ask random people to rank them on a variety of qualities:\n\nJust
  based on the name and logo...\n<ul>\n<li>\"Which of these pizza places would you
  consider the most likely to deliver a high-quality pizza?\"</li>\n<li>\"Which of
  these pizza places would you be the most curious about?\"</li>\n<li>\"Which of these
  pizza places would you think would deliver the best price for pizza?\"</li>\n<li>-and
  just for fun- \"If you were opening a pizza restaurant, what would you call it?\"</li>\n</ul>\n\nGrab
  a clipboard and a suit with a $20 box of chocolate bars and stand outside a mall,
  asking people questions in exchange for chocolate bars.  Heck, I'd be willing to
  do it for you! ^_^\n\nOf course, I understand that you're both pretty set in your
  ways- AND you've already registered the name (that's a couple of hundred bucks right
  there!).. heck, I'm already camping 778pizza.com on the off chance that you'll need
  it (or on the off chance that I want to stick a picture of my own butt on the internet)-
  given that, though, I at least urge caution with the name.  \"That's stupid\" is
  *not* the first thing you want people to think of when they think of your restaurant.\n\nWith
  the quality of pizza you produce, you could be successful with ANY name (\"Poop
  Sandwich Pizza\"), but you'd be surprised at how much of a difference the name can
  make- both in attracting customers and making sure they remember your pizza. The
  time to make changes is now, before you start establishing a brand. \n\nI'm no marketer,
  but the time I've spent learning about marketing (it's one of those things you try
  to pick up if you want to get into design) - suggests that your name, your logo,
  and over-all, your *brand* is SERIOUS BEANS. \n\nOn the other hand, like I said
  before, with the quality of pizza you produce, I'm sure you'll be successful with
  *any* name.  Good luck!"
