content: ! "Okay, I am full of lies.  I advertised 'the ultimate pasta sauce', but
  given that 'ultimate' means 'final', for it to really be the ultimate pasta sauce
  it would have to be the last pasta sauce ever. This would cause a notable amount
  of pain and suffering in the universe and would best be avoided.  Instead, I wish
  to speak to you on the topic of delicious pasta sauces- namely, *MY* delicious pasta
  sauces, and how you, too, can be a man brandishing a bowl of delicious red goo.\n\nThe
  thing about pasta sauce is that it can be described as 'free-form' food. You can
  toss just all sorts of things in there. Be creative.  When I first asked my mom
  for the recipe, she gave me a kind of loose description of how the sauce would go,
  and I was baffled- what do you mean? I need a hard, codified recipe, here! With..
  measurements, or something!  \n\nAfter getting mom to <a title=\"The recipe\" href=\"http://wiki.lassam.net/index.php?title=Mom%27s_Pasta_Sauce\">write
  down the recipe with some sort of precision</a>, I made it- almost to the letter.
  Having done so, however, I started to understand why my mom was so vague with the
  recipe the first time around- it's so hard to screw up that I was afforded a tremendous
  amount of leeway with ingredients, cooking time, anything.\n\nHere's the recipe.
  \n\nFirst, you need a big-ass pot. <acronym title=\"In Waterloo I managed with a
  big-ass pot that seemed to be made out of aluminum and was roughly as thick as a
  can of Pepsi. \">Thicker pots are less likely to burn the sauce and deliver more
  even heat. </acronym>  That means, you don't have to worry about stirring as much.
  \n\nStart with vegetables. Good vegetables include carrots, celery, onions, garlic,
  diced spinach, peas, and just about anything else that's green and even remotely
  vegetable-like. Save the tomatoes for later.  Give the veggies a rough dice- nothing
  should be bigger than <acronym title=\"If you're a purist? d4. Lazy? d20.\">about
  a d6</acronym>.\n\nToss some oil in the pan, and on lower-medium heat start cooking
  the vegetables, starting with the <acronym title=\"carrots, onions, lead pellets\">denser-and-larger-ones</acronym>
  and gradually moving towards the <acronym title=\"finely diced garlic, mushrooms\">floppier-and-smaller-ones</acronym>.
  \ \"How long should I cook everything for?\"- it's not an exact science, just cook
  it for.. some time.  Like, 5 minutes or something.  That seems like a reasonable
  amount of time. As long as everything isn't rock hard or burned to a crisp, you're
  pretty much in the clear.  \n\nWhen you feel like you're done, or if something starts
  to burn and you want it to stop burning, it's time to move on to the next stage:
  Meat.  Now comes the question: What sort of meat goes in the sauce?  Well.. what
  sort of meat do you have?  You're going to be cooking this thing for a couple of
  hours, so you could toss just about any ol' thing in there and it'll probably do
  fine.  I like to take spicy sausages or chorizo and <acronym title=\"When squeezing
  the insides out of a sausage, never think of Two Girls One Cup\">squeeze out the
  innards</acronym>, maybe mix that with some ground beef or something.  The process
  of cooking a big tomato sauce is very close to that of <a title=\"Braising\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braising\">braising</a>,
  so if you're looking to leave the pot on for a while you can toss some tough cuts
  in there and just cook 'em until they fall apart. This is, quite fortunately, delicious.
  \ So, for the meat stage - anything that you feel like putting in there is fine.
  \n\nIf you've got a bigger cut of meat, say, some chuck steak, you might want to
  crank up the heat in a separate pan and sear the outsides before you toss it in.
  \ You can cube it up now, or you can fish it out later, shred it, and toss it back
  in.\n\nToss your meat in the pot.  Wash your hands- you've been touching raw meat
  and food poisoning is no fun for anybody. Heat it up a <acronym title=\"Medium,
  I guess?\">little</acronym>, get some brown going on in that meat. There will be
  sizzling, and joy.  The meat's going to cook in the sauce for a long time anyways,
  so it's not imperative that you do a perfect job, here, but a good brown coat makes
  for added deliciousness.  If you're working with a lean meat, you won't have to
  drain the fat, but if you're working with something <acronym title=\"Sausage!\">fattier</acronym>,
  you might consider tipping the pot and ladling out any accumulated greasiness. \n\nAfter
  this, you can add all of the rest of the ingredients in any order without worrying.
  If you put the tomatoes in before the pasta, or the pasta in before the tomatoes,
  there will be no vile consequences.  These operations could even be executed in
  parallel if that's what floats your boat.\n\nNow you've got a pot with some meaty
  vegetableness. Nice work! Now, it's time to add some tomatoes.  You can add chopped
  fresh Roma tomatoes, here, or canned plum tomatoes, or hell, even grape tomatoes
  if you're feeling silly.  Don't be stingy, as tomatoes are a prime source of deliciousness.
  \ Try not to toss anything in there that's too much bigger than 'bite-sized'.  \n\nNow
  is also a good time to toss in 'the spices'-  to call it a 'pasta sauce', you need
  to add, at the minimum, basil and oregano.  If you're using fresh stuff, try not
  to get too much stem in there- a big chunk of stem in your pasta is bad times. Also,
  if you're using fresh herbs, use a *lot*- the flavours aren't as condensed as they
  are in the powdered and dried spices.  <acronym title=\"While you're adding these
  ingredients, humming the lyrics to Scarborough Fair is both appropriate and timely\">Parsley,
  sage, rosemary and thyme</acronym> are great additions, too. Don't be shy with the
  spices- big handfuls are appropriate, especially in the case of poor parsley with
  it's mild flavor. A couple of heads of <a title=\"Roasting Garlic\" href=\"http://wiki.lassam.net/index.php?title=Roasting_Garlic\">roasted
  garlic</a>, removed from the skin, makes for added deliciousness.  While adding
  spices, you might be overcome by a desire to just throw them in the pot and yell
  \"BAM!\". You can't resist it and you shouldn't try.\n\nWhat's next? Any leftovers
  you don't want to eat? Bright ideas? Clever ideas for last minute additions?  Forgotten
  vegetables from earlier? Now is the time to toss them in. Thai Chili Garlic paste,
  for example? Good stuff- adds some serious kick to the sauce.  Maybe some taco beef
  from that burrito you made yesterday? A little less appropriate, but still fine.
  A live kitten? Hairy, maybe, but full of flavor. \n\nFinally, toss in some tomato
  paste, about one big can's worth, and.. <acronym title=\"BLASPHEMY!\">a whole can
  of pasta sauce</acronym>.  It may not be the authentic way to go about it, but it's
  got about the right consistency to make the pasta sauce seem 'saucy'.  \n\n<acronym
  title=\"For non food-techies, this is known as a simmer.\">Now, turn the heat way
  up.  You want to see bubbles bubblin' to the top.  Once you've got everything to
  that point, turn the heat down to low, toss a lid on top of the whole process </acronym>
  and stir every 10 minutes or so for the next couple of hours.  Longer cooking times
  translate into more delicious sauces, but if you're in a hurry the whole thing could
  be done in about an hour or so.\n\nAnd now, for the important topic of 'sauce thickness
  management'.  After you've put all of the ingredients into the sauce, everything
  is going to be a little on the soupy side.  Hours of cooking will thicken the sauce.
  \ If you find your sauce getting too thick, it's time to add some liquid. I recommend
  Vitamin Wine, preferably something red.  If the sauce is too weak and liquidy, cook
  it longer.  This could theoretically take several hours, so fire up some Halo 3
  or some good T.V. and stir during commercials or between games.  Or not, the sauce
  isn't exactly delicate. \n\nThere.  You're probably drained, at this point.  Instead
  of the almost ridiculously easy process of pouring sauce out of a can onto some
  reheated noodles, you've blown several hours on a  time-consuming-but-not-too-difficult
  sauce. Was it worth it?\n\nWell, yes. For one thing, the sauce kicks ass. It's rich
  and meaty and delicious. For another thing, you can now Tupperware up the sauce,
  and freeze or refrigerate it.  Looking for a meal? Boiling noodles and tossing some
  microwaved sauce on them is dead easy, and you've got enough sauce in the fridge
  to keep you going for a good long time.  You can pick a Sunday, make huge pots of
  sauce, and be set in the sauce department for months. So, easy, delicious meals.
  \ Finally, it is a serious win in the cost effectiveness department. Noodles are
  dirt cheap, and for maybe $30-40 in ingredients, you now have many delicious, hearty,
  proteiny, vegetably meals lying ahead of you.\n\nBon Appetit!\n\n<i>Tomorrow: Coping
