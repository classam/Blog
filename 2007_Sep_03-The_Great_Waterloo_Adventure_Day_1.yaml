  alt=\"Boeing Jet\" />\n\nWe woke up at the ridiculously early hour of 8:00 AM (approximately)
  and actually woke up at the slighly more reasonable hour of 8:30 AM. After a brisk
  putting on of pants and luggage gathering, we were off.\n\nWe arrived at the airport,
  carted my huge set of luggage around, and discovered that the whole \"Airport Checkin\"
  thing had been replaced by an enormous, poorly explained checkin system, complete
  with roving, confused looking families and huge lineups.  Kristen immediately disappeared,
  causing some small alarm on my part- airport veteran that she is, she was scouting
  around for instructions. \n\nKristen located me once more and dragged me to a check-in,
  and it prompted me for my information on a touch-screen available in French and
  English.  The UI wasn't by any means pleasant or well-designed, but it was good
  enough that I managed to figure it out without making any grievious errors.\n\nThe
  entire airport is manned by asian people.  There was, maybe, one white guy on staff
  the entire time I was there. \n\nWe checked my big-ass bags- which was a relief,
  because they were huge and unwieldy.  I had pre-weighed them both at under 50lbs
  (the checked-baggage weight limit) by the simple expedient of standing on our home
  scale with and without the bags.  When the bags were checked, the larger bag was
  only .4 kg short of the limit- which would have meant a hefty $50 fine and a sad
  Curtis. \n\nWe had breakfast at a in-airport White Spot at about 10:30.  I had a
  BC Burger, which was to be my only meal for the next 7-8 hours.\n\nAround 11:30,
  we congregated at Gate C, and I gave everybody the wave/hug/kiss goodbye.  I made
  sure to turn around and wave at dad just before I passed through the gate. When
  I went to Japan, I wandered off without turning and waving, and didn't hear the
  end of it for a good 4-5 years.\n\nSecurity gave me the once over. Turn on the laptop,
  take off all of your metal, go through the box, put your coat in here, etcetera.
  \ I beeped on the way through, not sure what was causing it.  A quick arms-up scan
  revealed it to be my wallet.  \"What metal's in there?\" I thought.  (Oh yeah, change!
  Dumbass.)\n\n<img style=\"float:none;\" src=\"http://img2.timeinc.net/ew/dynamic/imgs/061013/16250__snakes_l.jpg\"
  alt=\"Motherfucking Snakes!\" />\n\nThere was 4 hours of boring, cramped plane-occupying.
  \ I spent the first 20 minutes full of adrenalin, waiting for the plane to take
  off and unable to concentrate on anything.  Once the plane took off, I relaxed and
  chilled out a bit, just concentrating on the boring task of killing as much time
  as possible.  I watched Fantastic Four - Rise of the Silver Surfer. It was terrible.
  I read a bit of my book.\n\nThe plane landed, I unloaded myself, and followed the
  HUGE arrows to the baggage claim, where I spent 40 minutes staring at a baggage
  carousel thinking of what would happen if my luggage didn't arrive or was stolen.
  \n\nAt this point, I thought I'd finally read the Wright Limo instructions to see
  what I had to do. I had hoped there'd be a guy holding a sign with my name on it.
  \n\nAt 8:00 (Toronto time, that's a mere 5:00 in Vancouver) I had my luggage, and
  quite possibly the worst $2 baggage cart in the world (stupid right wheel stuck).\n\nThe
  Wright Limo instructions specified that I had to find Terminal One and speak to
  the Commissioner. He would call the Limo over for me. \n\nI found these instructions
  a little bit tough. Where is this mysterious Terminal One? Who is the Commissioner?\n\nI
  pushed my carts in what seemed like the right direction- outwards- and eventually
  found a \"Terminal 3\", which seemed right- if I'm at Terminal 3, and I keep walking
  in a direction, the number will eventually either be 2 (Which means I'm walking
  in the right direction) or 4 (Wrong direction).\n\nMy plan, however, turned out
  to be wrong.  I walked down a bit, and eventually found myself in an area that was
  still marked \"Terminal 3\", but with a sign saying \"Welcome to Terminal 1\" on
  one of the doors. \n\nBaffled, I wandered around. Terminal 1 was quite large, and
  there was no big sign pointing me to the \"Commissioner\".  In fact, finding the
  \"Commissioner\" took a good 10 minutes, roaming around.  I didn't say a word- I
  felt asking every well-dressed person I saw, \"Are you the Commisioner?\" would
  come off as a little silly.  I looked for a sign, trying to discover the location
  of this mysterious commissioner.  A taxi driver approached me and gave me the sales
  pitch (\"I can get you there, now!\") and I brushed him off, but asked him where
  to find the commissioner- aha!\n\nI talked to the commissioner, waited a bit, saw
  my limo. I was a little disappointed- it wasn't a stretch, merely an expensive looking
  Lincoln.\n\nThe driver was chatty and pleasant, and told me that RIM works almost
  exclusively with Wright Limo.  There's so much business that he makes probably 3
  trips a day from the airport to Waterloo, even in the middle of the semester.  He
  said that the RIM developers he's had in his limo have been a very pleasant bunch-
  in all his time driving us around, he's only had one rude customer and apparently
  that guy was fired from RIM a few weeks afterwards for having a poor attitude.\n\nWe
  arrived at the house.  I was worried (I worried pretty much the entire day) that
  the place wouldn't be open, or we wouldn't be able to find it, or (worst of all)
  that it wouldn't exist at all- the whole thing only a clever scam on the part of
  a Waterloo con artist.\n\nNope- the door was wide-open and the Landlord was downstairs.
  \ He's finishing the downstairs bedroom with some new flooring and a new coat of
  paint for the next few days, so he'll be around a bit.  \n\nHe gave me the run-through-
  small kitchen, big living room, assorted bedrooms, bathroom, pots, pans, dishes,
  dishwasher, fridge, beer-fridge.  He seems like a nice guy- he's a few years older
  than I am, and this is his first property.  The rental agreement (another thing
  I was worried about) was simple and fair, and there weren't any egregiously silly
  house rules.\n\nWe went upstairs and I picked the bigger of the two available bedrooms.
  I signed the papers and Onirik (landlord) left.  Nobody else was home (apparently,
  Mike or Mark or whatever Roommate 1's name is was out, and Tim won't arrive until
  this morning).\n\nNo internet until Saturday, no phone or TV at all unless we arrange
  it. I'll be getting a Blackberry soon (I hope) and I don't watch TV, so that shouldn't
  be a problem.\n\nI then switched bedrooms.  The smaller one had a nicer bed, and
  I didn't bring a lot of stuff. I like small, cozy bedrooms anyways. \n\nThere was
  a flurry of frantic unpacking. At this time, it was 11:00, and I was hungry and
  mighty stinky. First of all, I unpacked everything in the world and stacked it all
  in my room. Then, there was the shower. Then food.\n\nThe cupboards and fridge were
  pretty bare (They had the following: Flour, Sugar, Olive Oil, Peanut Butter, Salt,
  Bottled Water, and Pepper).  I opened and ate a can of chili and a can of Ravioli
  (Thanks, Kristen!), cleaned up my plates, watched Scrubs, and went to bed at 1:00.\n\nWoke
  up at 6:30 (Yeah, that's not a lot of sleep. I'm excited, so sue me.) Chilled out
  a bit, Mike/Mark/? was home but sleeping in his bedroom.  A bit lonely (Where are
  people?).  Ventured out into the wild, in search of wireless internet and breakfast
  materials.\n\nNo internet, so I couldn't put together a map.  Oh no! Turns out,
  there was an okay map in the Phone Book- I knew those things were handy for some
  reason! I copied the map onto a piece of paper, prepared to annotate it with the
  locations of all local goodies.\n\nWalked about. Everything in the universe is closed
  for Labour Day. There were a few pay-phones, but it's too early for anybody to accept
  a collect-call (4:00 Vancouver).  \n\nThe first little shopping area was maybe a
  3-4 minute walk away from the house.  It has a Homestyle Diner, a Pizza Pizza, a
  Farah Foods Supermarked, a \"The Beer Store\", a Shoppers Drug Mart, a Subshack,
  a Little Caesars, a Timmy Ho's, a Pay Phone, a Thirsty's Bar n' Grill, a Butcher/Deli,
  a Dry Cleaner, a Sushi place, Chinese food, a convenience store and an Indian food
  restaurant.\n\nI found RIM. The buildings looked beige and office-parky and kind
  of depressing.  It's really a very short walk from where I live.\n\nI wandered about
  the University.  I laughed when I saw a huge sign bearing the U of W's new motto-
  \"Spirit of 'Why Not?'\". (Here's an <a title=\"A slippery origin for the Spirit
  of Why not?\" href=\"http://imprint.uwaterloo.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=850&Itemid=55&issuedate=2007-01-26\">article</a>
  about it- I'm not joking!)  That's quite possibly the most hilariously apathetic
  motto I've ever heard, and some nearby students must have thought I was insane.
  (Big random laugh? Nutter!)\n\nI pondered whether I could rent a bike for 4 months.
  \ It seems like the perfect way to navigate around Waterloo.\n\nI figured, if I
  wandered around campus enough I might find some free wireless access or some terminals
  or something.  I was right- free wireless access and terminals- but they were both
  password protected.  I remembered that there's a clever way to get around password
  protected open wireless spots- scan all connected IP's, then steal the MAC address
  of a computer that's already authenticated- but there was nobody around who was
  connected and I didn't know how to spoof a MAC quite yet, anyways.  \n\nThere are
  loons and squirrels everywhere- and they aren't afraid of humans at all. *QUACK*.
  \n\nI then found a big shopping centre near the University, with food from every
  concievable ethnicity (Egyptian, Bangladeshi, Korean, Taiwanese..) a 24-hour-food-mart
  that's actually open (I'm going to get some eggs and bacon there for breakfast,
  if I can) and a Fedex\\Kinkos with a Laptop Docking station (free internets!).  \n\nSo
  now I'm in the Kinkos, plugged in, and sending e-mails to various family members
  indicating that I'm not (in fact) dead.\n\nI'm going to buy some eggs, bacon, toast
  and hashbrowns- as well as some other staples, go home, and see who's interested
  in breakfast. \n\nI'll be back here later, though- it's got the internet (which
  I need) a PC Store (I'm going to try to hook our house up with a cheap-as-shit fileserver
  & printer), and a food-mart.  \n\nAnother big post tomorrow, on my roommates (Who
  I haven't met yet) and my first day at RIM."
