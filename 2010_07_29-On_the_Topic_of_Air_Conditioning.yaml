  articles expound endlessly on a topic that is completely and utterly ridiculous.</em>\n\nGood
  afternoon, the internet. I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of having cool air
  blasted up my shorts, am wishing that I had an air conditioner in my house.\n\nAccording
  to this thermometer that I've been keeping in a pot of boiling water, it's at least
  100 degrees Celsius in here. That is way too hot. I am sweating like Dolph Lundgren
  in a sauna filled with packing foam.  This poor leather couch, it never had a chance.
  \ \n\nAdmittedly, I'm forced to consider the air conditioner because some of my
  previous schemes to cool the apartment down have failed. Let's look at some of them.\n\n<h3>Plan
  A: Bag full of ice.</h3>\nWhen the frostbite heals, I might be able to use my toes
  again. \n\n<h3>Plan B: Frantic arm-waving</h3> \nThis plan was actually successful,
  but I got tired after 9 or 10 hours and couldn't keep going.  I was getting strange
  looks from the other people on the Skytrain, anyways.\n\n<h3>Plan C: Create an Enormous
  Rocket and Use it to Shoot the Earth Exactly 1 Foot Away From the Sun</h3>\nUnfortunately,
  logistical difficulties in this plan created some problems - some couplings melted,
  I ran out of money, and my engineering lead sued me for having a hostile workplace
  environment.\n\n<h3>Plan D: The Dutch Twist</h3>\nI had to promise the police that
  I wouldn't discuss the details of the Dutch Twist.  Let's just say that those preschoolers
  will never be the same again.\n\n<h3>Plan E: Hat-Fan</h3>\nFun but ineffective,
  as I have exhausted the world's entire supply of AA batteries. \n\n"
