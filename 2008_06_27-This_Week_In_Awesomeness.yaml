content: ! "Here are a few things I've found awesome recently:\n\n<h3> Ladytron's
  Velocifero </h3>\n<img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61mdh4w6VqL._SL500_AA240_.jpg\"
  alt=\"Velocifero\" />\n\nWhen I heard that Ladytron had a new CD out, I was practically
  vibrating with excitement.  I even went to HMV, hoping to buy my first CD in <strong>years</strong>.
  \ They didn't have it, and I was frustrated, but see how close I came to actually
  purchasing a CD?  Even in this day and age! \n\nLike all of the Ladytron albums
  (and most albums from any band) there were a few really strong hits that grabbed
  me from the outset- <a title=\"Ladytron: Ghosts\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEBg0b8hoUs\">Ghosts</a>,
  as a fine example, was just awesome from the get-go.  The rest of the CD just seemed
  like 'more of the same', boring, lah-dee-dah.  You can't listen to a whole CD worth
  of new songs at once from the same band, I've found. \n\nI tossed the CD in my morning
  wake-up CD-player, however, and found myself humming a different song from the CD
  every couple of days. Aren't new CD's always like that? At first, you fixate on
  the hit singles, but after a while you start to enjoy the whole CD.\n\n<h3> Flobots'
  Fight With Tools</h3>\n\n<img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61i1Qy7jPTL._SL500_AA280_.jpg\"
  alt=\"Fight With Tools\" />\n\nOkay, so, these guys have a hit on their hands with
  \"<a title=\"Flobots: Handlebars\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuK2A1ZqoWs&feature=related\">Handlebars</a>\".
  \ \n\nHonestly, I usually can't abide by anti-corporate fight-the-power music.  Honestly,
  from a group that's owned by <a title=\"Universal Music Group\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Music_Group\">Universal</a>,
  that's a pretty hypocritical stance to be taking.  The feeling that I'm having pre-packaged
  rebellion *sold* to me is just dirty.\n\nOn top of that, as a white upper-middle-class
  software developer, I am The Man. Convincing people to rebel against The Man is
  almost entirely counterproductive from my standpoint.  \n\nGiven that, the CD has
  a couple of pretty catchy songs. \n\n<h3>Frontpaged on Proggit</h3>\nMy post <a
  title=\"Curtis Lassam: IRCulated\" href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=455\">\"IRCulated\"</a>
  hit the front page of programming.reddit.com and stayed there for a good two days.
  On top of that, a bunch of Redditors <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/info/6oyhq/comments/\">contributed
  their own jokes</a> along the same vein. \n\nThe page got over 4000 visitors (that's
  big, for me).  Neat.\n\n<h3>They found ice on Mars!</h3>\nAnd the first that anybody
  heard about it was on <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/06/mars-phoenix-tw.html\">Twitter</a>!
  \n\nI'm curious which has more downtime- the Mars Lander or Twitter.  \n\n<h3> I've
  found a new hero. </h3> \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXJKdh1KZ0w\">This
  man</a> is my new hero. \n\n<h3> Meet The Sniper and the TF2 Pyro Update came out.
  </h3>\nIf you're not familiar with the Team Fortress 2 \"Meet The *\" series, they're
  all <a title=\"Meet The Sniper\" href=\"http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=app&AppId=5051&cc=US\">hilarious</a>.
  \ I haven't even tried the new Pyro updates, yet.  But I will. Oh, I will. \n\n"
