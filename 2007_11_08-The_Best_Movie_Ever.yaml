content: ! "A short while ago, my roommate Mike introduced me to the best B-movie
  I've ever seen in my life - Commando. \n\nCommando was the movie that inspired the
  first Die Hard. Here's a quick synopsis:  Arnold Schwarzenegger plays \"John Matrix\",
  an ex-commando who lives in obscurity with his daughter.  His wholesomeness is driven
  home by a montage of activities with his daughter, which include eating ice cream,
  laughing, and <i>feeding a wild fawn</i> . His daughter is kidnapped by a group
  of rebels who want to use John Matrix to assassinate the head of state of a nonexistent
  Latin-American country (It was \"Baldevia\" or something like that). They pack him
  on a plane, set to land in Baldevia in 11 hours.  So, in order to save his daughter,
  within 11 hours, John Matrix kills <i>every single person in the entire rebellion</i>.
  The movie is a non-stop, action-packed killing spree marked with occasional breaks
  for John Matrix to spout off a snappy one-liner or rip a phone-booth out of it's
  moors.\n\nMatrix: Remember, Sully, when I promised to kill you last?\nSully: That's
  right, Matrix. You did.\nMatrix: I lied. \n\nJust watching this movie, I grew a
  full moustache and beard. Sound like an awesome time? Mike has two copies, so I'm
  going to try to buy one of them and bring it home with me. Perhaps I will use the
  awesome power of science to distill pure, uncut manliness from the DVD itself."
