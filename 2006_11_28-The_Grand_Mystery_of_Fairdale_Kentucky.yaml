  Why? Because I''m a vain, vain person. Yup.


  I''ve had about 60 site visits this week: Certainly not the thousand-or-so that
  Movieset.com gets in a week- but then, I don''t have an uninteresting movie featuring
  <a title="Who the hell is Channing Tatum" href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=Who+the+hell+is+Channing+Tatum%3F&btnG=Google+Search&meta=">teenage-heartthrob
  Channing Tatum  </a>and the dangerous, smouldering Ray Liotta of "Goodfellas" fame.
  (So what else did he do? Not much.)


  The thing is, though, 58 of those visits came from the Lower Mainland. That makes
  sense, everybody I know lives in the Vancouver area.  Then there''s one from Ottawa.
  Okay, I can see someone with CSSS connections being in Ottawa.


  But who in the heck visited from Fairdale, Kentucky? Who are you, mysterious Kentucky
  stranger? Will you come back? Why did you come here?


  There are so many mysteries.'
