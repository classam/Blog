content: ! "VIGS Summary\n\nThe Vancouver International Game Summit began with a visit
  from two B.C. political types (Larry Campbell and something something)- one of whom
  delivered a moderately rousing speech about how B.C. supports it's game developers,
  and the other of whom briefly said something about 'game something something' and
  then launched into a diatribe about how he was committed to lowering the cost of
  living in Vancouver.\n\n<h3>Keynote: Shane Kim</h3>\n\nShane Kim, corporate Vice
  President for Microsoft Game Studios, sat in a rich-and-quiet Microsoft sort of
  way while a journalist completely failed to get any interesting comments out of
  him.  \n\nHe somehow claimed that Xbox Live has a lot of features for non-subscribers-
  which I took a bit of offense to, because I'm pretty sure that you need to subscribe
  to *play games with your friends* - and what other cool features are there? \n\nBungie
  is mentioned- Microsoft (of course) wants to continue a healthy business relationship
  with them.  Xbox Live might do full digital distribution someday but they're not
  going to commit to anything, and Xbox Live Arcade is the <em>bees knees</em> for
  small game companies.  Nothing on a motion sensing controller, or Blu-Ray.\n\nMr.
  Kim said \"milestones\" a lot and \"paradigm\" at least once, earning him my eternal
  enmity.\n\n<h3>Panel 1: The Story and Focus Narrative</h3>\n\n<blockquote> How does
  a story go from paper to full game integration?  What are the issues, challenges
  and decisions that have lead to these great game successes.  This panel will discuss
  how the writer and game producer were able to take a great story and make it a living
  success.</blockquote>\n\nIn the first session, I was offered the choice of learning
  about 'untapped markets', 'new frontiers in animation', or 'the story and focus
  narrative'.   I ended up choosing the third of the set-  I wouldn't be writing this
  in the first place if I wasn't interested in writing, ya?   It was a panel of three
  writers. \n\nThe first thing established by the board of writers was that players
  don't listen to dialogue, or read dialogue.  They just skip through it as quickly
  as possible to get their next quest.\n\nA lot of times, as well, the story created
  in the character's head overrides the story provided by the game.\n\n<blockquote>
  One experience from the game Lost: a player was busy gathering coconuts when a plane
  crashed just off in the distance.  Instead of going off in the distance, though,
  the player just kept dutifully gathering those damn cocounuts. </blockquote>\n\nIn
  order to get a story across to these people, you have to aggressively simplify it
  and hit them with it over and over again. For the more involved players, additional
  storyline bits can be left optionally throughout the storyline.\n\nPlayers also
  frequently save and quit, and come back to the game again later- so the story's
  narrative has to be redundant in many places to remind people what's happened and
  what they should be doing next.\n\nA game comes with a predefined story and a large
  set of constraints to work with- be it limited characters and animations, limited
  props, and limited quests.  A lot of game writers have had to work around the fact
  that the world is completely littered with crates, or that 95% of the quests are
  'get me 22 rat's tails'. \n\nWith the vast amount of NPC's that you meet in many
  games, it's good to give them distinctive traits- speech patterns, quirks in appearance,
  little stories. \n\nIt can have emotional clout to make the player do something
  in the game that the character would do- but the player wouldn't.  \n\nIn <acronym
  title=\"Knights of the Old Republic\">KOTOR</acronym>, most of the people took the
  good path, a smaller group of people started down the evil path, couldn't take it,
  and then went down the good path, and a much smaller group of people went all of
  the way down the evil path. \n\nOne writer said that in games with creative directors,
  elements like art and writing seemed to gel better.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth\"
  title=\"Wikipedia: Monomyth\">The Hero's Journey</a> is alluded to as a common structure
  for game narrative.\n\nSome writing exercises are discussed: What's the worst thing
  that could happen to a character?  What's the worst day for a character?  \n\nThen,
  lunch.\n \n<h3>Adapting Your Technology to Multiple Technology Platforms</h3>\n\n<blockquote>
  This panel will provide a few case studies on how technology forces major design
  decisions such as what platforms the game will be played on and how the design of
  a game needs to be adjusted for a multi-platform game.  Challenges faced and lessons
  learned will be discussed. </blockquote>\n\nThe next presentation was on the technology
  track.  Three panelists talking about the difficulties they've had working with
  the PS3.\n\nWhile theoretically the talk was about developing software for the Xbox
  360 and PS3, apparently the gap in functionality between the two is so aggressively
  weighted towards the Xbox that the real problem was getting developers to work with
  the PS3.\n\nThe companies all had different approaches.  EA had a deep layer of
  abstraction allowing the games to take advantage of the power of both systems.\n\nPropaganda
  Games did a lot of work with middleware to produce a solution that ended up working
  on both platforms-  mostly, working around the many deficiencies of the PS2. \n\nAlso,
  Propaganda Games reminded us that the one and only game that they've produced has
  been <a href=\"http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/30-Turok\"
  title=\"Zero Punctuation: Turok\">Turok</a>.\n\nIn the questioning period, the panelists
  all drove home the point that developers should get things working on the PS3 first-
  because it's the more difficult system, and then getting it to work on the Xbox
  360 will be less troublesome. \n\n<h3> Technology Roadmap </h3>\n\n<blockquote>
  Technology is expensive.  It doesn't matter if you are buying or building, technology
  is going to cost you plenty.  Making the right choices for technology can make or
  break a company.  The good news is your company wants a long-term strategic plan.
  \ The bad news is you have been \"volunteered\" to create it...  Building a working,
  long term strategic plan will involve a lot of blood, sweat, and tears.  A company's
  success or failure can be decided by the technology choices that are made.  Planning
  a technology roadmap, involves much more than just programming, it involves all
  disciplines of content creators along with IT, management, and production.  This
  session will describe BioWare's journed to create a company-wide Technology Roadmap.
  \ It will cover the successes and failures; what was learned from the process and
  the ongoing challenges still facing the company.  </blockquote>\n\nScott Greig,
  the senior architect from BioWare, delivered one of the best presentations of the
  conference- his information was organized, fast-paced, and structured.\n\nI have
  pages and pages of notes that may not translate the best into a blog post, but let's
  try anyways.\n\nA technology roadmap is a strategic, ongoing planning tool for everyone
  in the company.  Content-creators (animators, artists, writers..) need to know what
  sort of capabilities they'll have available in the games and when.  \n\nThe technology
  roadmap is a plan for what capabilities are needed, when they're needed, and how
  to deliver them. \n\nAs a couple of general rules:\n\n<ul>\n<li>It has to be somewhere
  where people can find it. </li>\n<li>Everybody has to buy-in.</li>\n<li>It's not
  the same as centrally directed technology. (Which a lot of game teams are very suspicious
  of)</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe process discussed was one to determine what the company's
  focus is (in Bioware's case, storytelling), what capabilities are needed to support
  that focus (in Bioware's case, some capabilities include systems to deal with massive
  amounts of dialogue and create dozens or thousands of unique character models),
  then plan for how to deliver these capabilites- who will do the work, when can it
  be done, etcetera.\n\nA lot of little tips were thrown in for each step of the way-
  but looking back at them they seem almost too disjointed to write down. \n\nSo I
  won't. Moving on.\n\n<h3> Fostering The Leaders of Tomorrow </h3>\n\nA talk about
  leadership.  If you've ever heard leaders talk about 'what is leadership', you understand
  quite exactly how boring this talk started out. \n\nAfter that, the discussion turned
  to women in the video game industry- mainly, the lack thereof. \n\nI can't believe
  that people managed to talk about it for a full hour.  \n\nMy thoughts on the matter?
  \ Western culture drives women away from math, science, and engineering.  The only
  solution is to not do that so much.  I know if *I* have daughters, they're getting
  the full nerd treatment. \n\n<h3>Lo-Fi Prototyping</h3>\n\nThe Lo-Fi Prototyping
  panel was pretty slow.  It was a panel discussion, but not a planned panel discussion,
  so there pacing was pretty slow. The panelists talked about how getting any prototype
  of a game running is a fantastic way to tweak the game for gameplay elements. \n\nIt
  was pretty slow, and in the next room some big audio started to play.  I really
  had to investigate. \n\n<h3>Audio Production</h3>\n\nWhen I first came into the
  audio production room, they were talking about how to make music more interactive.
  \ I immediately spaced out and started thinking about how I would implement an interactive
  music system- first of all, I thought about how to deal with prerecorded music-
  mix a variety of intensity values of the same song, with filters to increase and
  decrease intensity, and prepare transitions between states.  The intensity could
  then be tied to in-game variables.  It would, of course, be incredibly time-consuming.
  \  \n\nThen I thought of dynamically generating the score based on a 'seed' score
  and a variety of variables- and that would be less 'time consuming' but far more
  difficult. \n\nSo, watching the presentation, the Halo team at Bungie used a dynamically
  generated score - and they presented a gameplay clip from Halo 3 that was amazing.
  \ The music flowed responsively with the game, and wasn't even interrupted by a
  cut-scene.\n\nAnother presenter had worked on the Def Jam games had tried the first
  technique that I had thought of - the table based one. (Clearly, the game industry
  is several years ahead of me).  It wasn't quite as seamless as the Halo offering,
  but it was still pretty good. \n\nA Lucasarts guy mumbled his way through a boring
  demo, perked up by the occasional grandiose bouts of John-Williams-esque fully orchestrated
  music. \n\n<h3>The Art and Technology of Game Animation </h3> \n\n\tWe started with
  Athomas Goldberg, from EA Canada, describing EA's <acronym title=\"Animation Tools
  & Libraries\">ANT</acronym> framework- which is developed by EA's central tech,
  used in a variety of games, managed by a central team, and contributed-to by many
  different EA teams and groups. \n\t\n\tThe ANT system is very plugin-based- with
  plugins to work with inverse kinematics, foot-plant management, locomotion control,
  etcetera...\n\t\n\t<blockquote> 75% of the plug-ins used by NHL 08 were developed
  by other game teams. </blockquote>\n\t\n\tThe project was described as being 'internal
  open-source', which kinda yanked the short-hairs of my internal free-software pedant.\n\t\n\tWe
  then saw a short demo of some plug-ins on a NBA player.  \n\t\n\tWayne Gilbert from
  EA showed us a movie of some skaters skating in mocap, and complained about how
  game animation isn't held to the same high standard as traditional animation. \n\t\n\t<blockquote>Everybody
  lives by the metacritic- and the metacritics are getting nasty.  It's getting harder
  to please everybody. </blockquote>\n\t\n\t Mr. Gilbert works with the Skate team
  and seems to be a heavy advocate of quality over quantity- something I wouldn't
  usually expect from EA.  He is on the Skate team, though- maybe I should give that
  game a try...\n\t\n\tBrad Kinley from Bioware, working on Mass Effect 2, talked
  about the animation tree used to generate most of the animations in the game.  The
  whole 'animation tree' concept went a bit over my head- he showed us the tree, but
  I had little to no clue how that tree would translate into in-game animations. \n\t\n\tApparently,
  Mass Effect's character animation framework was so heavyweight that only a few characters
  could be reliably animated at the same time- limiting the amount of on-screen characters
  that they were prepared to show.  Mass Effect 2's trees will be streamlined to allow
  for a lot more simultaneous animations. \n\t\n\tIn order to deal with the massive
  amount of dialogue in a Bioware game, Brad Kinley went over the process by which
  conversations were automatically generated by the system- with lip-synch automatically
  generated and paired with body gestures and motions.  It still looked pretty wooden,
  but as 100% procedurally generated dialogue goes, it was some of the best I've seen.
  (\"Bronze animations\")  \n\t\n\tFor most scenes, they took the procedurally generated
  dialogue and layered emotions and additional gestures on top of that. (\"Silver
  animations\") - this might take a couple of days per scene.\n\t\n\tFor important
  scenes, they went much more closely into camera control, emotions, and available
  animations.  These could take as much as a week to get right- \"Gold animations\"\n\t\n\tChristian
  Gyrling from Naughty Dog's Uncharted: Drake's Fortune described their animation
  framework- a multi-layered abstraction that's not too complex- the animation itself
  is an object that handles requests for things like 'running' or 'shooting' and manages
  state.  The amount of programmatically generated content is very slim- all of the
  animation is lovingly hand-crafted from motion capture, and then animations are
  additively blended (running + turning + shooting) to produce a variety of slick
  animations.\n\t\n\tPast that was a finishing keynote which I missed out on in order
  to miss the rush home. \n\n<h3>Food</h3>\nThis is the third time this year (gasp)
  that I've eaten Hyatt banquet food, and it's proven to be a less-than-pleasant experience
  once again-  theoretically, it's fancy food, but it's got this greasy, disappointing
  feel to it every time. Blah. \n"
