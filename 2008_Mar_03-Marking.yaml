content: ! "I just recently went through 70 exams, performing some marking on the
  first chunk of each exam.  It took the entirety of my Sunday and most of Monday-
  \ my Saturday having been occupied by a funeral. \n\nLet me tell you- marking is
  quite possibly one of the most boring things in the universe.  Any sustained time
  spent marking is just a big pile of wasted life. \n\nI'll be glad to get out of
  academia if I ever get a chance. "
