  400-level-summer-offering this semester.


  How many 400-level-courses is the CS department OFFERING, Curtis?


  Well, mysterious question-asking stranger- 4, one of which is in Harbour Centre,
  one of which I''ve already taken, one of which is in The Wrong Stream, and one of
  which is Complicated and Mathy.


  I only need 2 400-level courses (and MACM 316) to graduate- I was hoping I''d be
  able to do it over the summer.  I guess not. '
