content: ! "(Xianny) Eyebrows, the chubby rogue, (Curtis) Richard, the mage who is
  also a chef, and (Marcel) The Generic Dwarf, made amends- having forgotten the violent
  events of <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=549\">last day</a>.  The inn
  that they occupied had also attracted (Kristen) Athena, the somewhat-spacey cleric.
  \ She described herself as 'normal' and agreed to help with the Kobold problem that
  everybody was having.   \n\nOn the road to the Kobold's lair, the party of four
  encountered... Kobolds! <em>(surprise!)</em>  Having a cleric on the team proved
  to be a significant step forward, and the Kobolds were summarily dispatched.  Eyebrows
  started to get a feel for the hunt- learning that her sneaky hits from behind did
  a lot more damage. Spirits were high.  The party found a dark little figurine in
  the hands of one of the Kobolds.  Richard successfully identified it as a fetish
  of Orcus, dark god. \n\nTravelling forward, the team found... more Kobolds! This
  time, a whole awful lot of Kobolds in a forest.  Generic Dwarf managed to shake
  off several javelins to the important bits.  The team worked together and once again
  made mincemeat of the forest-ful of Kobolds.  One of the Kobolds managed to dash
  off, yelling \"Irontooth must be warned!\".  How ominous. \n\nThe party followed
  the escaped Kobold into the most Kobold-ful spot yet- a cave, containing Kobolds
  of all stripe- as well as an axe-wielding goblin with a rather spectacular amount
  of hit-points.  \n\nOne well-placed fire-spell managed to clear the caves of 8 of
  the Kobolds- after which Richard cracked his knuckles and tossed off a pithy comment.
  \ Another 2 Kobolds were knocked clean unconscious by a spell of Sleep, leaving
  only the axe-wielding super-goblin, a Kobold priest, a Kobold skirmisher and a Kobold
  minion.  \n\nThe cleric, however, foolishly ran to the front lines, putting her
  in a position where the remainder of the Kobold forces could concentrate their attacks
  on her.  She fell unconscious.  After taking a near-fatal series of blows from the
  axe-wielding goblin, the Generic Dwarf attempted (and succeeded) first aid on the
  cleric.  \n\nBetween the two of them, they managed to stay alive a bit longer in
  battle, but in the fray the axe-swinging goblin took Eyebrows' head clean off.  In
  one blow, she went from a healthy albeit battered rogue to a pile of relatively
  useless meat.  \n\nThe onslaught proved to be too much- the Dwarf fell, and Athena-
  unable to heal him any further- instead just decided that an expeditious retreat
  was in order.   \"Book it!\", yelled Richard as they made haste for the woods. <a
  href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=580\">Again</a>.\n\nThings seemed bad for
  Generic Dwarf, but luck was in his favour and he rose.  Surprising the goblin, he
  succeeded at an intimidate check (one assumes, yelling \"DWAAAARF!\") shocking the
  goblin enough so that he could nab Eyebrows' dead body and leave.\n\nAthena arrived
  at Winterhaven first, and retired to the pub for a nice ale. \n\nThe Dwarf and Richard
  arrived next, quibbling about what to do with the dead body of Eyebrows.  While
  Generic Dwarf favoured rescuing her, Richard argued that the going price for such
  a resurrection was 500 gold pieces- not a paltry sum, and clearly out of the price
  range of the team. Richard suggested instead that they dump the body in a nearby
  creek and attempt to find a new hero willing to join the team.  (Note to the DM:
  If you feel that it's more appropriate for Richard to be Unaligned instead of Good
  at this point, I wouldn't resist it any.) \n\nTo make his point, Richard suggested
  that resurrections don't just grow on trees, idly tapping the battered lump that
  was Eyebrows' corpse with the Orcus figurine that he had earlier acquired.  In retrospect,
  not the greatest idea.  Eyebrows' corpse started shambling up with a new, dark life.
  \ Richard shrieked like a little girl (\"ZOMBIES!\") and paced away, leaving the
  Generic Dwarf to deal with the zombie Eyebrows.  \n\nGeneric Dwarf mistakenly thought
  that Eyebrows had come back to life, and attempted first aid- only to be slammed
  by the undead's fury.  At this point, Richard had regained his composure and froze
  the zombie from a safe distance.  \n\nWell, at least the body disposal problem had
  been solved.  \n\nI'd like to take this opportunity to point out that our team's
  Rogues are having a definite Spinal Tap Drummer problem. \n\n<blockquote>Although
  the band arguably had 32 drummers during its history, these are the six that are
  mentioned by name:\n\n<ol>\n<li>John \"Stumpy\" Pepys (1943-1969) Cause of death:
  Gardening accident.</li>\n <li>Eric \"Stumpy Joe\" Childs (1945-1974) Cause of death:
  Choked on vomit, although it was never determined whose vomit it was. </li>\n<li>Peter
  \"James\" Bond (1949-1977) Cause of death: Spontaneous combustion </li>\n<li> Mick
  Shrimpton (1948-1982) Cause of death: On-stage explosion. </li>\n<li> Joe \"Mama\"
  Besser (19??-1983) Cause of death: Missing, presumed dead, or playing jazz.</li>\n<li>
  Richard \"Ric\" Shrimpton (1948-?) Cause of death: No one knows what happened to
  Ric. None of the band members thought to ask each other. We've also heard that he
  sold his dialysis machine for drugs, and we assumed he died. </li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n"
