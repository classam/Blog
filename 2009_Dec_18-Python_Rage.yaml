  <ul>

  <li> <strong>* ian6</strong> IS FILLED WITH LOTS OF RAGE AND VERY LITTLE PIE. </li>

  <li> <strong>Boose:</strong> Java fills everybody with rage </li>

  <li> <strong>Boose:</strong> Except it''s not rage. </li>

  <li> <strong>Boose:</strong> If you were programming in python, it would be rage.</li>

  <li> <strong>Boose:</strong> It''s Java. </li>

  <li> <strong>Boose:</strong> It fills people with subclasses of AbstractRage, such
  as APIRage or ToolRage, which also implement the GenericAnger interface, and can
  only be called from a RageFactory, which itself is an abstract class that must be
  called from a RageFactoryFactory.  Once you have the SpecificRage, you can compose
  it into an abstract EmotionalState (which, once again, you must both subclass and
  instantiate with an EmotionFactory), which you then must alter </li>

  <li> <strong>Boose:</strong> with MoodDecorators and ImageFacades. </li>

  <li> <strong>katep:</strong> lol </li>

  <li> <strong>katep:</strong> I wish that was short enough for a tweet </li>

  <li> <strong>Boose:</strong> It''s at least tidy than PHP, which just has 39 rage
  functions, which, in order not to break backwards compatibility have names that
  are totally different, as well as an Object interface that doesn''t do anything.  </li>

  <li> <strong>Boose:</strong> These functions include:</li>

  <li> <strong>Boose:</strong> rage_arrgggh()</li>

  <li> <strong>Boose:</strong> rage_punch( $object )</li>

  <li> <strong>Boose:</strong> punch_a_kitten( )</li>

  <li> <strong>Boose:</strong> rage2_arrrgh() </li>

  <li> <strong>Boose:</strong> prage_angry() </li>

  <li> <strong>Boose:</strong> (This is a perl-style rage function) </li>

  <li> <strong>ian6:</strong> emotion::emote($ragetype, $level)</li>

  <li> <strong>ian6:</strong> emotioni::emote($level, $ragetype)</li>

  </ul>'
