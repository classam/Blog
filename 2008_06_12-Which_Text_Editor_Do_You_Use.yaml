content: ! "One of the most important things that every programmer learns is that
  just about everything can be opened with in a text editor and fiddled with.  In
  fact, opening a text editor and fiddling with things is basically what programming
  is. \n\nClearly, the text editor is the most important tool in the programmer's
  tool kit, and just as clearly, Notepad shouldn't be that tool.\n\nOh, don't get
  me wrong- As a Windows user, Notepad is still pretty much my go-to editor for anything
  that's.. well, a note.  My whole computer is littered with little text files with
  names like \"Things Ted Has Told Me To Watch\" or \"Bacons Of The World\".\n\nBut
  when it comes down to editing code, I likes me a good, general text editor with
  a lot of features. Code highlighting, code-folding, block-indenting, a decent search-and-replace,
  it's all important stuff.  Without code highlighting, I'm sure I'd make three times
  as many errors as I forget to notice that I've closed a string or commented out
  the wrong bits of a code block. \n\nNote how I didn't say IDE- Oh, I like IDEs,
  too, but an IDE is for programming in an environment.  Visual Studio is for programming
  in /insert Microsoft Technology here/, Eclipse is for programming in /insert Sun
  technology here/, and you never want to jump beyond the bounds of their technology
  barriers. \n\nFor anything that you're editing that's not Java or .NET- and that's
  a wide world- a nice, general purpose text editor is definitely a must-have.  I've
  tried a couple, and here's my thoughts on them.\n\n<h3> Notepad </h3>\nDon't use
  Notepad.\n\nLet's try that again, but louder.\n\n<blockquote> Don't use Notepad.
  </blockquote>\n\n<h3> gEdit </h3>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.gnome.org/projects/gedit/\">gEdit</a>
  is notepad for Gnome- the notepad that comes standard in Ubuntu.  While Notepad
  for Windows is woefully inadequate as a text-editor for code, gEdit is much more
  multi-purpose.  It has code highlighting and tabbed editing, and- while feature-sparse-
  is a competent enough little text editor.\n\n<h3> jEdit</h3>\n\nYou may not have
  heard of <a href=\"http://www.jedit.org/\">jEdit</a>- most people haven't.  It's
  been my go-to editor for some time, and I am quite fond of it- if anything because
  I've grown used to it's quirks, ins, outs, etcetera.  \n\nIt's a Java-based text
  editor, using Java plugins to add functionality for just about everything.  Of course,
  because all of the plugins are built in Java, most of them don't actually work well
  or do anything. \n\nThe feature that got me on board more than anything was the
  dockable file browser.  When I'm working on a project, I like being able to see
  all of my files from that project in the left-hand pane. Said dockable file browser
  can also be ham-handedly coaxed into working with FTP or SSH, both convenient bonuses
  for remote work. \n\nMy love of jEdit, however, is somewhat diluted by that same
  property that eventually had me migrating from Azureus to uTorrent- Java may be
  cross-platform, but it's the same across all platforms: clunky, ugly, and hugemongous.
  \n\n<h3> TextMate </h3>\n\nSo, having recently purchased a computer from the fellows
  at 1 Infinite Loop, I decided, instead of embracing the way of the cross-platform
  Java editor, I'd try to see what Apple's large fanbase has cooked up as a way of
  editing text on the Mac.\n\n<a href=\"http://macromates.com/\">TextMate</a> is *gasp*
  shareware.  If you want the full package you have to <acronym title=\"pirate it\">pay
  for it</acronym>.  Now, I'll support that- I use my Text Editor more often than
  I use Team Fortress 2, Microsoft Office, or toothpaste.  I'm not really willing
  to pay for it until I've decided that it's a must-have text editor for the Mac,
  though. \n\nI am impressed by TextMate so far, however.  Like unto jEdit, it has
  a variety of plugins (in this case, \"bundles\") that can be used to extend the
  simple text editor into an IDE for every platform.  The difference, however, is
  that TextMate comes with a whole schwack of good ones. \n\nWhile it's good, though,
  it hasn't yet blinded me with science. (beep boop) \n\n<h3> Notepad++ </h3>\n\nSeeking
  a less hefty editor for the PC, I decided to give <a href=\"http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm\">Notepad++</a>
  a try.  It's rather well-respected.  I've used it maybe two or three times- not
  a lot, by any means- and it certainly has it's charm.\n\nIt doesn't display comments
  in a monospace font, though. I'm not sure what to think about that.\n\n<h3> eMacs
  & vim </h3>\n\nSo, as a programmer, you've long heard that there are two and only
  two text editors: eMacs and vim.  They are the 'shizzat', the cream of the crop,
  the top of the heap, and they did it *myyyyyy waaaaaaay*.\n\nSo given the fanfare,
  I've tried both of them.  Oh, I don't use either- in fact, I find them both quite
  frustrating.  I don't want to poke any bears- but eMacs and vim are difficult to
  use, and a lot of their fantastically wonderful functionality have been replaced
  by a recent technological innovation- the mouse. \n\nOn the other hand- you should
  pick either emacs or vim and learn enough of it to navigate around. See, the thing
  is- if you're doing work on a remote server, your choices are limited to emacs/vim
  or...\n\n<h3> pico/nano </h3>\n\nPico, or Nano by another name, is the command-line
  equivalent of Notepad, except with even less features.  There's no 'undo', even.
  \ Honestly, pico/nano is quite possibly one of the worst text editors out there.
  \ I'm not ragging on pico/nano, here- they're not meant to be big, beefy, powerful,
  serious text editors- they're designed to be small and convenient, which they manage
  expertly.\n"
