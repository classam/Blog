content: ! "So, I'm home with 'the sickness', was surfing the intertubes, and the
  plans for a simple-but-fun game jumped into my head. \n\nWell, it started out simple.
  It got more detailed as time went on. \n\nThe supplies are fairly ornate - a board,
  containing a 13x13 grid. A deck of cards. 60 tiles. A large handful of tokens, in
  a different color for each player.  Some form of low-value currency, representing
  'gold', in increments of 1, 5, and 10. 2-4 people. A 'first player' token. \n\nThe
  game proceeds as follows: \n\n<h3>Glossary</h3>\n\n<strong>N</strong> - Wherever
  you see \"N\", it means the number of players.  So, \"N+3\" means 5, if you have
  2 players, 6, if you have 3 players, and 7, if you have 4 players. \n\n<strong>H</strong>
  - The number of coordinate cards a player has in his hand. (N/2 = 1, if you have
  2 cards, 2, if you have 4 cards, 3, if you have 6 cards...) \n\n<strong>Coordinate</strong>
  - Each spot on the 13x13 board corresponds with an X,Y coordinate. This coordinate
  matches up with a pair of cards from a standard deck of cards, with 'A' as '1' and
  K as '13'. \n\n<strong>Coordinate Cards</strong> - Standard playing cards. \n\n<h3>Setup</h3>\nPlace
  the tiles face down, shuffled, in a large, unwieldy pile.  Glare at the pile. \n\nPut
  the board on the table, face-up.  Glare at the board. \n\nPut n+3 tiles, face up,
  in front of each player. Give each player 5 gold. Glare at the players. Give the
  'first player' token to some lucky schmoe. Glare. Begin the game. \n\n<h3>1. Upkeep</h3>\nAll
  players receive one gold piece, per turn, regardless of their status. \nShould players
  have Gold Mines, now is the time to determine how much additional gold they will
  produce. Hand out the gold.\n\n<h3>2. Get Coordinate Cards </h3>\nEach player receives
  a hand of 2 co-ordinate cards from the deck. If the player has Roads, they receive
  more co-ordinate cards. \n\n<h3>3. Buy Tiles</h3>\nThe tiles for sale are the tiles
  in front of the player with the 'first player' token.  The person who gets to buy
  first is also the person with the 'first player' token. Players may choose not to
  buy a tile on their turn. After the first player purchases or declines to purchase
  a tile, the 'buy' passes clockwise to the player on his left.  Should the first
  player decline to purchase a tile, he may <em>not</em> decide to purchase a tile
  again.  Players may purchase as many as H/2 tiles. \n\nAs soon as a player purchases
  a tile, he must place it on the board, at the set of coordinates defined by two
  coordinate cards from his hand.  He then must place a token on that tile, to mark
  it as his, and discard the coordinate cards.  \n\n<blockquote>Say, for example,
  Jonathan has a 7 and a K in his hand - after Jonathan buys a Farm for 1 gold, he
  must place it at either coordinate 7K or coordinate K7. </blockquote>\n\n<h4>Tiles
  are drawn from the following set: </h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Quantity: 8, Cost: 0 - Wall(
  Creatures may not intersect walls. )</li>\n<li>Quantity: 4, Cost: 1 - Farm (Generates
  3 gold at time of purchase.) </li>\n<li>Quantity: 4, Cost: 2 - Pit (Anything intersecting
  a pit is consumed. A pit may be played on top of any other tile. A pit may be played
  anywhere on the board. )</li>\n<li>Quantity: 4, Cost: 3 - Thief ( Kills bureaucrats.
  Steals property. Moves. )</li>\n<li>Quantity: 4, Cost: 3 - Monster ( Kills thieves
  & bureaucrats, destroys property. Moves. )</li>\n<li>Quantity: 4, Cost: 3 - Hero
  ( Kills monsters and thieves.  Moves. ) </li>\n<li>Quantity: 4, Cost: 3 - Bureaucrat(
  Kills heroes.  Moves. If a bureaucrat is on a property, that property is twice as
  useful as normal - the Gold Mine produces 1 extra gold during the upkeep phase,
  the Road produces 1 extra coordinate during the coordinate phase, and a Castle is
  worth 2 Castles for the purposes of winning the game. )</li>\n<li>Quantity: 4, Cost:
  3 - Road ( Generates 1 extra co-ordinate card per turn. )</li>\n<li>Quantity: 8,
  Cost: 4 - Gold Mine ( Generates 1 gold per turn. )</li>\n<li>Quantity: 12, Cost:
  6 - Castle ( The first player to have (12/N)+1 castles under his control wins the
  game )</li>\n</ul>\n\nFor the sake of resolving the Thief and Monster special abilities,
  'property' is the Road, Gold Mine, and Castle tiles. \n\n<strong>Wicked Witch of
  the East - </strong> A Pit may be dropped on anything.  A wall, farm, gold mine,
  castle, or road may be dropped on a thief, hero, monster, or bureaucrat, which <a
  href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim\">destroys
  the creature</a>. A creature can <em>not</em> be dropped on another creature, and
  a property can <em>not</em> be dropped on another property.\n\n<h4> 4. Move </h4>\nStarting
  with the player with the 'first player' token, everybody may move their creature
  tiles.  Creature tiles are the Hero, Bureaucrat, Monster, and Thief. Each creature
  may move three squares in a turn - vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally.
  \ Each player may move one creature before passing play to the left. If play returns
  to the original player, he may play another, repeating until all players have moved
  their creatures. A player declining to move any creatures forfeits his right to
  move creatures for the rest of the turn. \n\n<strong>Where we're going, we don't
  need - </strong> Moving into a 'road' tile does not count against movement.  A creature
  crossing 2 road tiles on his turn would be able to cross 5 tiles worth of space.
  \n\nCreatures may move across or end their move on Farms, Roads, Castles, Gold Mines
  or enemy creatures.  They may not move across or end their move on Pits, Walls,
  or friendly creatures. Should a creature end its move on an enemy creature of the
  same type (Bureaucrat on Bureaucrat, or Hero on Hero), they are both destroyed.
  \ All other effects (listed by tile) occur when the creature ends its move.\n\nDestroyed
  tiles go back into the tile pile. \n\n<h4> 5. Replenish </h4> \nThe player holding
  the 'first player' token shuffles the tiles in front of him back into the tile pile.
  He then draws N+3 more tiles. \n\nThe discarded coordinate cards are shuffled back
  into the deck. \n\n<h3> 6. Player </h3>\nThe player holding the 'first player' token
  passes that token, clockwise, to the player on his left. \n\n<h3> Variant Rules
  </h3>\n<strong>2-Player Walled Garden</strong> - The board has a line of 'double-coordinate'
  squares - (1,1) , (2,2), (3,3), ... (K, K) - Imagine this as a 'property line'.
  Each player chooses a side of the property line and must play all tiles behind that
  side of the wall.  Both players can play tiles on the double-coordinate squares.
  Pits may be played anywhere on the board. \n\n<strong>It's a Small World </strong>
  - 2 players may wish to discard and re-draw any co-ordinate cards &gt;= 10 to reduce
  the size of the world on which they play. "
