  post you all zonk out and start thinking of flowers and/or muffins? This one's for
  you.\n\nWhen working with graphics files- photos of your family, or <a title=\"Lolcat\"
  href=\"http://icanhascheezburger.com/2007/12/03/eeek-a-mouse/\">funny pictures of
  cats with captions</a> that you've downloaded from the internet, you'll find that
  each file is associated with a certain 'type'.  You might not be able to see it-
  Windows hides this convenient fact for you in a sort of behind-the-scenes 'this
  is beyond what you need to know' sense. \n\nYour first step is making sure Windows
  agrees with you when you say, \"I am in control of my own destiny and wish to know
  what type of file I'm using at any given time.\" <strong>Open any folder</strong>
  on your computer, then select \"<strong>Tools</strong>\" from the menu at the top
  of the window. (\"File\", \"Edit\", \"View\", Favourites\", \"Tools\")- then, \"<strong>Folder
  Options</strong>\".  There are four tabs at the top (\"General\", \"View\", \"File
  Types\", \"Offline Files\"). Select \"<strong>View</strong>\", then look at the
  options- you want to make sure \"<strong>Hide extensions for known file types</strong>\"
  is unchecked.  While you're here, there are a lot of other neat options that you
  can fiddle with.  \n\nOkay, so, now, file extensions are turned on.  All of a sudden,
  every file on your computer is accompanied by a dot and a three-letter code- .exe,
  .rtf, .doc, .kif, .etc\n\nThis code indicates to Windows what sort of file this
  is- there are entire sites on the internet dedicated to cataloging which extensions
  mean what- and you'll even see these extensions on the internet!\n\nHere's a quick
  run-down of some the most common extensions and their types-  there are lots more,
  and as you spend more time with your computer, you'll get to know which is which.\n<ul
  style=\"font-size: 80%; padding-bottom: 3px; padding-left: 3px;\">\n\t<li>.txt -
  Notepad</li>\n\t<li>.doc, .rtf - Word</li>\n\t<li>.exe, .bat, .com - A program of
  some sort. (Never download or run one of these!)</li>\n\t<li>.ppt - Powerpoint Presentation</li>\n\t<li>.xls
  - Excel Spreadsheet</li>\n<li>.mp3 - mp3</li>\n\t<li>.zip - Zipped up file (Containing
  lots of smaller files)</li>\n<li>.bmp, .jpg, .png, .tif, .pdf, .gif, .ai - Images
  </li>\n</ul>\n\nNow, while extensions are a fun little bit of computer trivia, what
  we're going for here is a quick introduction to the different types of image files
  and when to use them. \n\nLet's start with <strong>.bmp</strong>. .bmp stands for
  \"Bitmap\", and it's the default sort of file generated by good ol' MSPaint.  A
  bitmap is a hideously inefficient way to store an image, and you should simply <em>never
  use a bitmap</em>. \n\nOh, as a side note- When I say 'use a bitmap', what I mean
  is that in whatever image processing program you use, when you go \"Save As\", you
  can usually choose what \"Type\" of file to save your image as.  Never save your
  image as a bitmap.\n\nOkay, on to <strong>.gif</strong>- The \"Graphics Interchange
  Format\"- they're good for clear images without a lot of colours and can handle
  basic transparency- for layouts with clearly defined breaks in colour, like logos,
  .gifs are highly efficient.  Their most common appearance is on websites. If you
  have a choice, you probably don't want to use this format, either.\n\nNext, the
  hearty <strong> .jpg </strong> or <strong> .jpeg </strong>, for Joint Photographic
  Experts Group (the group that created the format).  The JPEG format is a highly
  efficient way to send photographic images- it compresses them to a much more reasonable
  size, without sacrificing too much in the way of colour or quality.  Chances are,
  if you're sending something to someone to look at, you should use a .jpg file. When
  it comes to sharp corners or text, though, .jpegs can seem a bit fuzzy- you'll see
  this on amateurish websites, sometimes. \n\nThe sexy <strong> .png </strong> file,
  for \"Portable Network Graphics\", is designed to work as an improved .gif file.
  \ Although file sizes tend to be a little bigger, .png files have much better transparency
  and quality. Thanks to the fact that .png files are supported by Internet Explorer
  7, Firefox, and pretty much every other modern web browser, you'll be seeing a lot
  more of these in the future. If you're showing someone a sample design or a logo,
  a .png file is the way to go.\n\nOn to the proprietary and special stuff:\n\nA <strong>.psd</strong>,
  or \"Photoshop Document\", is a file that can be used within the popular graphics
  program Photoshop.  .PSD's keep all information related to an image in full quality,
  as well as layering information and all sorts of other neat stuff.  Adobe Photoshop
  is the most expensive graphics package currently in use, and through some devil
  magic it also happens to be the industry standard- graphics designers, web designers,
  printers, everybody has a copy of Photoshop (<a title=\"The Pirate Bay: Photoshop
  CS3\" href=\"http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3917681/Adobe_photoshop_cs3\">pirated</a>
  or no).  It's noticeably more difficult to use than any other graphics package,
  too.  If you go to a Kinkos or Staples or other professonal print shop, they'll
  have Photoshop installed on their computers- so they can use these files, too.  If
  you want to make changes to an image, then you pretty much must have a .psd file
  somewhere with all of your data saved in it- and if you want to print your image,
  it's best to print directly from the .psd instead of compressing it to one of the
  other formats first.  \n\nA <strong> .tiff </strong> file (\"Tagged Image File Format\")
  is sort of a cheap Photoshop file.  It doesn't do quite as much as a .psd file,
  but other, non-PhotoShop software can open it.  If you're not using Photoshop or
  giving the file to someone who doesn't have Photoshop, but you still want to send
  a full-quality editable file, use a .tiff. \n\nA <strong>.ai</strong> is an \"Adobe
  Illustrator\" file.  All of the Photoshop rules above apply for the Illustrator
  file- the difference is that the Illustrator deals with \"Vector Images\"- images
  that are composed of lines instead of dots. Vector images can be infinitely resized,
  and are great for logos- you can make the logo as large or as small as you want
  without affecting the image quality!  Vector images are also great for printing.
  Once again, any print-shop you go to should have Illustrator installed for you to
  print these files with. \n\nA <strong>.svg</strong> is a \"Scalable Vector Graphics\"
  file- like an .ai, but free. If you're sending an Illustrator file to someone who
  doesn't have Illustrator, use .svg. \n\nAn <strong>.indd</strong> is an \"InDesign
  Document\". Adobe InDesign is a powerful page layout package - when I was an editor
  for The Peak I used it to lay-out pages. (And then Amanda would mock me terribly
  and point out off-by-one-pixel errors with her hawk-like eyes.) InDesign can (and
  is) often used to produce .pdf files. \n\nFinally, <strong>.pdf</strong> - the \"Portable
  Document File\", is a combination image and text file, largely considered one of
  the better ways to transport books, menus, or other printed materials across the
  internet.\n\nOf course, all of my friends are now screaming to themselves. \"What
  about lossless vs. lossy graphics? Isn't that important?\".. well, yeah, but it's
  too much unwanted detail, for now, I think.  \"What about free, open-source editors
  like The Gimp, or Inktomi?\" - well, while I love free, open sourced software, you
  aren't going to see these files nearly as often as the Adobe stuff. \n\nSo, now
  that I've pounded you with all of this unnecessary information, here's the summary.\n<em>For
  pictures, use .jpg, for designs and logos, use .png, and for printing and unfinished
  work, use the Adobe tools and get someone to help.</em>\n\n\n\n\n\n"
