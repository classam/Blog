  212</a>. MFC is GUI programming from Windows 3.1  (<i>Note: The CS Department has
  been attempting to reform 212 lately. If Kirkpatrick is teaching it, we're putting
  the course on probation.</i>)</li>\n<li> <b>Travis</b>: Learn a programmer's text
  editor, like Vim or Emacs, then use it for everything. </li>\n<li> <b>Dan</b>: <a
  href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=381\">Go to BCIT</a> if you want to become
  a better programmer. </li>\n<li> <b>Travis</b>: Socialize with your peers and upperclassmen.
  </li>\n<li> <b>Dan</b>: Use LaTeX - professors will give you better marks.  </li>\n<li>
  <b>Dan</b>: When doing your assignments, test early and test often. </li>\n<li>
  <b>Dan</b>: Document before you write. </li> \n<li> <b>Travis</b>: If your schema
  has more than three circles, you're going to fail. </li>\n<li> <b>Dan</b>: Windows
  is useless- you may like it but it will slow you down. </li>\n<li> <b>Travis</b>:
  You'll learn more in the Common Room than you will in your courses. </li>\n<li>
  <b>Dan</b>: Intro to Computer Graphics is not near as much fun as you think it is.
  </li>\n<li> <b>Travis</b>: Take Compilers (<a href=\"http://www.cs.sfu.ca/undergrad/Outlines/2007-1/@SURREY-CAMPUS/CMPT-379-Shermer-07-1.txt\">CMPT
  379</a>). </li>\n<li> <b>Dan</b>: Don't take the Software Engineering stream, it's
  useless. </li>\n<li> <b>Travis</b>: See the woman in the class beside you? She is
  twice as hardcore as you are. </li>\n<li> <b>Dan</b>: Regarding women: Don't stare.
  Also? They speak English, not that patronizing tone that you're currently using
  for them. </li> \n<li> <b>Travis</b>: Small textbooks are better.</li>\n<li> <b>Dan</b>:
  Never take more than 2 CMPT courses per semester. </li>\n<li> <b>Travis</b>: Working
  while sleep-deprived is not an effective way to get stuff done.</li>\n<li> <b>Dan</b>:
  Go to bed, finish tomorrow.</li>\n<li> <b>Travis</b>: Ergonomics. It matters.</li>\n<li>
  <b>Dan</b>: Get a ergonomic keyboard. Laptops are terrible. Don't bend your wrist.
  Basically, the bone in your middle finger and your arm should be straight. Do finger
  exercises every hour. </li>\n<li> <b>Dan</b>: For the love of god, go to the Prof's
  office hours. Not the TA's office hours, the Prof's office hours. </li>\n<li> <b>Dan</b>:
  Use the IRC channel (irc.freenode.net, #sfucsss).</li>\n<li> <b>Dovic</b>: If you're
  going to fail, learn to give good blowjobs. </li>\n</ul>\n"
