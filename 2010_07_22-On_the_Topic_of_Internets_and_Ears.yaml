  articles expound endlessly on a topic that is completely and utterly ridiculous.</em>\n\nGood
  afternoon, the internet. I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of bandwidth, have
  just had my internet connected.\n\nWhich is awesome, because the internet, to me,
  is like an appendage.  Not a really important appendage, like an arm, but at least
  one of the less critical appendages, like an ear or a nostril.  In the same way
  that I would feel a little odd with one less ear, that is the way that I feel without
  internet at home.  At the very least, I would need to tape one side of my glasses
  to my head. \n\nThe telecom guy came to my house at a very inconvenient time of
  day. People looking to get internet and TV installed have two options: Either they
  get it installed during normal work-hours on a weekday &mdash; something that is,
  in my opinion, <em>completely worth</em> taking a vacation day for &mdash; or, alternatively,
  waiting in line for <em>exactly one billion years</em> for an available weekend
  installation date.  I ended up opting for secret option number three - having an
  unemployed girlfriend. \n\nThe installation went smoothly, though, and when I came
  back from work I had connectivity once more, as well as television.  The cable box
  included the full TV mumbo-jombo super-television mega-TV pack, and yet somehow
  forgot to include anything worth watching.\n\nBut, far more importantly, my home
  has reasonably fast internet, internet that I can use to play video game (yes, just
  <a href=\"http://teamfortress.com/\">one video game</a>), read <a href=\"http://www.kukuburi.com/\">comics</a>,
  and <a href=\"http://webchat.freenode.net/\">communicate with others</a>. \n\nI
  still have to tape my glasses to the side of my head, though. "
