  This is a stanza from the song "Skullcrusher Mountain" by <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/store/downloads">Jonathan
  Coulton</a>.  He writes songs about DNA, Zombies, Furry Old Lobsters, Ikea, the
  Mandelbrot Set, and any number of other nerdy topics. Many of these songs are hilarious
  and/or catchy, and I highly recommend you listen to some of them.


  I made this half-pony half-monkey monster to please you

  But I get the feeling that you don’t like it

  What’s with all the screaming?

  You like monkeys, you like ponies

  Maybe you don’t like monsters so much

  Maybe I used too many monkeys

  Isn’t it enough to know that I ruined a pony making a gift for you? '
