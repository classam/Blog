  href=\"http://forums.koalawallop.com/viewtopic.php?t=1719\">here</a>.\n\nIt sounds
  like fun! What type of Time Traveler would you be? \n\nI'm thinking crazy hair,
  and at some point a chalkboard. \n\n\"At some point in the past, something caused
  the timeline to SKEW!\", I could say, drawing a line and then another line under
  it. \"Now we're in some alternate 1985!\" \n\nThe whole time I was reading about
  branching and integration in Perforce, I was thinking just that.  \n\nIf time-travel
  is ever invented, only source control nerds will understand how to manage it. "
