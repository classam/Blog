  and I discover someone has left a message under my request for various Starslip
  Crisis goodies.Â  ''Twas Kristopher Straub* himself, a veritable captain of awesomeness.
  (Perhaps even a major general of awesomeness; Kristopher Straub is to awesomeness
  as .. rank.. is.. to... oh, fuddle, I''ve botched a simile again.)


  Now, as a intellectual, cultured individual**, this would usually be the time for
  a solemn, but moderately joyous "hm".


  But the avid web-comic-following-fanboy inside of me says only this: "OMG Scree!
  Kristopher Straub!"


  * For those of you who don''t know who Kristopher Straub is, he makes the online
  comic "Starslip Crisis", widely renowned for being the only funny webcomic set in
  the future. Go read it now! The link''s in my sidebar!.... Yes, I can wait.


  ** Sure, yeah, you laugh now. It could be true.'
