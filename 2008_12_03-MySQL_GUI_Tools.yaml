content: While I was working at EA, I became a tad addicted to the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/gui-tools/5.0.html">MySQL
  GUI Tools</a>.  They're convenient and slick, and they make me a happy man. It's
  the Query Browser, really- functionally equivalent to just opening ssh, logging
  in, typing in 'mysql', and entering queries manually.  The big difference is the
  fact that you get a bigger screen, multiple windows, and you can save queries and
  data.
