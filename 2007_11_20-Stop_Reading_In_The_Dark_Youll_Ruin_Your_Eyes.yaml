content: ! "I got the \"Stop Reading In The Dark\" complaint from my parents, grandparents
  and the like quite a few times.  Hey, I don't need a lot of light to read- and all
  of the light bouncing off of the white, white pages usually just makes it harder
  to read.  \n\nAnd it turns out, I was right- <a title=\"Medical Myths\" href=\"http://www.uams.edu/news/medical_myths/\">reading
  in the dark can't effect eyesight</a>. \n\n<blockquote style=\"padding: 10px 10px
  10px 10px; background-color: #EEEEEE;\" >As a rule, you cannot damage your eyes
  by using them, according to Nicola Kim, M.D., an assistant professor of ophthalmology
  at UAMS’ Jones Eye Institute. “There are a few specific exceptions, like looking
  directly into sunlight and laser light, but other than this, reading in dim or bright
  light will not change the health or function of your eyes. It may feel more difficult
  to focus if the lighting is suboptimal, but this has no permanent effect on the
  structure of your eyes. In addition, any challenging visual activity will generally
  decrease a person’s blink rate and lead to discomfort from drying. This is obviously
  temporary and easily treated with lubricating eyedrops. Likewise, sitting too close
  or too far from the TV will also have no permanent effect on your vision.”</blockquote>\n\n"
