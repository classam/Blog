  concoct a simple religion from scratch.  It is designed to be as logically tight
  and as self-propagating as possible, without being difficult to understand.\n\n\tOkay,
  first we need to work on spreading this fellow as far and wide as possible.\n\n\t<strong>The
  Book of Propagation</strong>\n\n\tLet's say there are two major ways of spreading
  this religion- evangelizing and indoctrinating.  How about let's guess which one
  is more effective? That's right, indoctrinating.\n\t\n\t<strong>Propagation Rule
  1</strong>: Teach Your Kids All The Rules of The Church of the Ephemeral. Enforce
  these rules zealously. \n\n\tNow, given that we want you to have plenty of these
  children, and we want these children to have lots of children...\n\n\t<strong>Propagation
  Rule 2</strong>: You must endeavor to have as many children as possible, and keep
  them alive. No contraception, no exceptions.\n\n\tNow, a little bit of research
  is showing that the indoctrination works better with two steady parents- not to
  mention, your children are more likely to survive that way. STD's are also a thing
  that we frown on, and we don't allow protective measures.. so our next rule.\n\n\t<strong>Propagation
  Rule 3</strong>: You have to pick one partner to have sex with. That's it. Once
  you've had sex with that person, it's that person forever. That person must be female.
  Females who can't bear children don't count.  No exceptions. No homosexuality, that's
  right out. You *really* need to have some kids. Baby it up a little. Indoctrinate
  them. \n\n\tI think that about covers the indoctrination route- although there's
  an edge case I think we should cover.\n\n\t<strong>Propagation Rule 4</strong>:
  Should you bring up a child with someone of a different religion, being that THIS
  is the CORRECT religion, THIS is the religion that the child will be indoctrinated
  in.\n\n\tOkay. Now on to evangelizing- a very important part of the religion. \n\n\t<strong>Propagation
  Rule 5</strong>: It is your duty as a member of the Church of the Ephemeral to convert
  everybody else (within your power) to the Church of the Ephemeral. Pamphlets are
  a good way to go. Really try to sell it.\n\n\tNow, once somebody is converted, we
  want them to survive as long as possible- making babies and converting people, so
  no killing 'im.\n\n\t<strong>Propagation Rule 6</strong>: There will be no killing.\n\n\tAdditionally,
  we don't want you doing anything rash that might cause your fellow church-members
  to *want* to kill you. We want you all to do well.  If you're curious, look up zero-sum
  game theory to explain why this next one is probably a good idea.\n\n\t<strong>Propagation
  Rule 7</strong>: There will be no stealing, nor fiddling with peoples' wives, nor
  cheating or lying.\n\n\tHowever, it's a distinct benefit to steal, cheat, kill,
  and lie to people outside of the Church- especially if it improves the lot of Church
  members.\n\n\t<strong>Propagation Rule 8</strong>: Rules 6 and 7 don't explicitly
  apply to anybody who's not a Church member. Try not to bring this rule to people's
  attention.\n\n\tWhat else needs to be laid out, here? I think that's about it for
  propagating the religion. Now, a lot of these rules don't make sense in-and-of themselves-
  their whole purpose is just to be self-propagating. They need some sort of.. explanation.\n\tSo
  how do we explain all of these silly rules? \n\t\n\t<strong>The Book of Deity</strong>\n\t\n\t<strong>Deity
  Rule 1: </strong> Because God Said So. (\"God Did It\")\n\n\tThis also solves the
  problem of all of that stuff that bothers people about being alive- who put us here,
  what are we doing, etcetera. Of course, you have to wonder to yourself.. how did
  he pull off such an amazing trick? How did he go about creating the universe? Well,
  we could concoct an elaborate explanation- he set off some sort of big bang, he
  initially set all of the parameters that a universe would require to generate human
  life, maybe he set all of the rules of the universe in a bunch of #define statements
  and then just let the compiler sort the rest out- but this is all very complicated
  and theoretical, (not to mention potentially disprovable) and it's much, much easier
  just to say \n\nthat..\n\n\t<strong>Deity Rule 2</strong>: God Is Omnipotent (All-powerful).\n\n\tSo,
  we have an all-powerful creator.. he has the means to enforce the rules, and explain
  every concievable thing via the simple expedient of <em>force majeure</em>- but
  how does he know if you break one of his all-important rules? \t\n\n\t<strong>Deity
  Rule 3</strong>: God Is Omniscient (All-knowing).\n\nNow, some of the cleverer folks
  in the back might have come to the conclusion that it's impossible to be both Omniscient
  and Omnipotent- if you can predict the future accurately, you are unable to change
  it. I'm going to have to say, you're thinking far too much and probably won't be
  happy with The Church Of The Ephemeral. Let's go to Rule 4, then.\n\n\t<strong>Deity
  Rule 4</strong>: All percieved logical contradictions in the rules are there because
  God Put Them There. (See Deity Rule #1).\n\n\tThis doesn't seem like enough of a
  blanket statement. What about some sort of contradiction between Scientific Evidence
  and The Rules? What if the moral zeitgeist changes?\n\n\t<strong>Deity Rule 5</strong>:
  Should these rules disagree with scientific evidence or moral opinion, the science
  or morals are wrong.\n\n\t<strong>Deity Rule 6</strong>: Should these rules disagree
  with overwhelming scientific evidence or moral opinion, they are just metaphors
  and not to be taken seriously in this day and age.\n\n\tNow, you're probably wondering..
  why is it that these rules are here in a handily readable text-format? I mean, it's
  not like God himself came down to Earth and handed these rules to us, right? How
  do we know God wrote this stuff down?!\n\n\t<strong>Deity Rule 7</strong>: These
  rules are the word of God himself.\n\n\tWe now reach the point where you start to
  wonder.. \"How do we trust the guy who gave us these rules? He could just be any
  old jackass!\"\n\tNot when we consider the next rule in the series!\n\n\t<strong>Deity
  Rule 8</strong>: The guy who hooked me up with these rules was magical. \n\n\tHe
  had an inside-line with that God fellow I was talking about earlier. He could turn
  monkeys inside-out with nothing more than a tap on the shoulder. I saw it in person-
  therefore, everything I write is the Word Of God Himself.\n\n\tFinally, to discourage
  all scientific inquiry into this God, the following:\n\n\t<strong>Deity Rule 9</strong>:
  God, being omnipotent, is powerful enough to avoid any detection attempts by non-omniscient
  agents.\n\n\tSo, now our argument has a feature-complete God and a circular argument
  that can't be punctured by any concievable human logic. This is definitely a good
  start.\n\nNow.. how can we simultaneously scare people into following the rules
  and reward people for following them overzealously?\n\n\t<strong>The Book of The
  Afterlife</strong>\n\n\t<strong>Afterlife Rule 1</strong>: If you break the rules,
  you'll definitely go to a very unpleasant place, and you will not be happy at all.
  Let's call this place \"COBOL\".\n\n\t<strong>Afterlife Rule 2</strong>: If you
  follow the rules, you'll definitely go to a very pleasant place, and you will be
  very happy. Let's call this place \"Python\". \n\n\tOkay, so now we've got the problem
  where people break one rule, and they think they're condemned to COBOL. That's no
  good, we can't have that- they'll ruin the whole thing!\n\n\t<strong>Afterlife Rule
  3</strong>: If you break the rules, and apologize, and promise not to break them
  ever again, you can still get to do the Python thing.\n\n\tNow, some competing religions
  haven't defined any really clear rules about what happens with people who are intellectually
  incapable of following the rules- animals, mentally-handicapped people, premature
  deaths.. Well, let nobody say that we're not thorough.\n\n\t<strong>Afterlife Rule
  4</strong>: Animals, mentally handicapped people, and anybody who dies before they
  turn 20 universally get to go to Python.\n\n\tOh! A loophole! You can do whatever
  you want and kill yourself at the age of 19, and still get in!  \n\tNo way, Jose!\n\n\t<strong>Afterlife
  Rule 5</strong>: No suiciding. You'll end up in COBOL.\n\n\tWhoo, all this religion-creating
  is getting me exhausted. Okay, what keeps people from believing in an all-powerful
  god? \n\n\t<strong>The Book of Logistics</strong>\n\n\tSuffering is a good one-
  how can people continue to suffer when there's a god there who can keep it from
  happening? Well, there are two potential ways to look at it.\n\n\t<strong>Logistics
  Rule 1A</strong>: God Doesn't Like You. (If You Don't Do What He Says, He'll Lay
  Down Some Suffering, Or Maybe He'll Just Smack You Around Because He's Having a
  Bad Day.)\n\t\n\tFor an example of this, see old Greek and Roman myths, or even
  the Old Testament. Now that was a God who wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty by
  being nice to people. It wasn't really warm and fuzzy enough for most people, though.
  it didn't feel good- no, everybody pretty much rolls with the second major explanation,
  now.\n\n\t<strong>Logistics Rule 1B</strong>: God Likes You, But Suffering Makes
  You A Better Person.\n\n\tThis is a good one- you can trot this old war-pony to
  explain just about anything bad that could potentially ever happen.\n\n\tNow, I
  also need to be able to change this document around if I think of a rule that I
  might have forgotten.\n\n\t<strong>Logistics Rule 2</strong>: Curtis Lassam is God's
  Representative, and therefore can make changes to this document. The most recent
  version of this document is God's Will and you must follow it to the letter, else
  risk COBOL.\n\n\tAs a side note, I don't want this text getting all muddied up.\t\n\n<strong>Logistics
  Rule 3</strong>: The most recent version of this document is the Word of God directly,
  and so must not be changed or altered. Translations must be as accurate as possible
  (To avoid that whole \"73 virgins/raisins\" deal)\n\n\tAdditionally, too much thinking
  in general is probably a bad thing. Let's make the last rule the most important
  rule.\n\n\t<strong>Logistics Rule 4</strong>: No questioning the rules- thinking
  too much is on the list of things that'll get you into COBOL. The greatest virtue
  is believing whatever the hell you're told. Let's call it 'faith'. \n\n\tThat seems
  like about everything. If you want to make any changes to the formula, you have
  to do it at some point before I die, so you might want to get your suggestions in
  early."
