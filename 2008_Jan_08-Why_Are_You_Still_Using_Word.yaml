content: ! "Just a few days ago, I received an e-mail from my <acronym title=\"Intro
  to Probability and Statistics\">STAT 270</acronym> professor, containing course
  notes.  These notes were, painfully, sent in a format only really readable by the
  dreaded Word.\n\nNow, when I got a new computer, I never bothered to install Word.
  I'd have to steal it, and that's a big pain in the ass for the fairly negligible
  benefit of having Word installed on my computer.  While I'm technically the family's
  go-to-guy for poached software, I'd prefer to only recommend the sub-legal stuff
  when the Open-Sourced alternative is a difficult, hacked together nightmare- say,
  Blender or The GIMP.\n\nThing is, with Word, there are alternatives that are actually
  very good.  I'd like to direct your attention to <a title=\"OpenOffice\" href=\"http://www.openoffice.org/\">OpenOffice</a>.
  \ OpenOffice can do just about everything that Word can.  It quite notably does
  not cost a couple of hundred dollars.  If you create an OpenOffice document, you
  can be quite secure in the knowledge that anybody else who owns a computer will
  be able to open it and view it properly, as long as they have an internet connection
  and a little bit of guidance. \n\nOpenOffice is one of the heavy-hitter technologies
  that comes bundled with Ubuntu - for a desktop system, having a complete office
  package right out of the box is one of the major selling points of our Linuxy pal.
  \ \n\nIt's not ugly or difficult, either- in fact, the OpenOffice utilities are
  quite happily very similar to their Microsoft Office counterparts- in some cases
  more powerful.  For scripting, OpenOffice interfaces quite happily with Python,
  the <acronym title=\"YOU shut up!\">best damn programming language ever</acronym>.
  \ \n\nNow, in my understanding, everybody has Word. If you send someone a Word document,
  they are almost guaranteed to be able to open it.  If they have a Mac they might
  still have Word. If they don't have Word, at least Wordpad will come to the rescue
  and deliver a horribly mangled version of the original file.  Word is a pretty safe
  format to send people documents in- they're almost always likely to have it.\n\nOpenOffice,
  however, is an even safer choice- anybody can get a copy of OpenOffice for free.
  \ It runs on Macs, Windows, Linux, the works. Many governments are actually switching
  their documents to the <acronym title=\"OpenDocument Format, Lingua Franca of the
  OpenOffice Writer\">ODF</acronym> format from <acronym title=\"Word Document!\">DOC</acronym>
  and <acronym title=\"Rich Text Format, more Word\">RTF</acronym>- the open nature
  of the file means both that it's more accessible to the public, and less likely
  to become obsolete and impossible to open over time.\n\nSo.. uh.. yay OpenOffice.
  \n\nSo, given all of that jerkery over OpenOffice, the real thing I was wondering
  was.. why weren't the notes prepared in some sort of TeX?  Even LyX! I mean, it's
  a math professor, right?  Math departments and LaTeX go together like <acronym title=\"mmmm\">peanut
  butter and bananas</acronym>.  TeXy documents are just really good for that mathy
  stuff- and it produces beautiful PDFs.  \n\nI've come to associate TeX documents
  with academia, and the lack thereof- especially for the sort of document that looks
  like it was built with TeX in mind- seems odd.  Sections, subsections, formulas
  upon formulas- if you're doing that stuff in Word, you're doing too much work! It's
  already been implemented better somewhere else!\n\nWell, we'll wait and see.  \n\n"
