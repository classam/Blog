  OF AFRICA (BOA). OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO.


  Dear Friend,


  I am  MR Ahbed Dialo the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of  Bank
  Of Africa(BOA) Ouagadougou Burkina-Faso West-Africa with due respect and regard.
  I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial
  to both of us at the end of the transaction.


  During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a
  very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person Mr.Sheu Yuan-dong who died
  on February 16, 2000 in a gassy car accident with his entire family on there way
  back from Bobo Delaso the formal capital city of Burkina-Faso, and the fund has
  been dormant in his account with this Bank

  without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation
  before our discovery to this development.


  The said amount was U.S $9.8M (Nine million eight hundred United States dollars).
  As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through yahoo
  search on foreign business relations here in Ouagadougou Burkina-Faso.


  Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bona fide
  next of kin to the deceased, to get the required approval and transfer this money
  to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information
  will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to
  assist us and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.


  In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country
  as a civil servant (A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and
  would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because
  I work in this bank.


  This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who <script><!--
  D(["mb","will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath
  to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be  re-transferred
  into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the
  correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to
  your own designation bank account.


  I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On smooth
  conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the total sum as
  gratification, while 60% will be for me. Please, you have been advised to keep &quot;top
  secret&quot; as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we
  conclude this deal with you.


  I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the
  money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing
  of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment,
  either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary
  vital information will be sent to you when I hear from you.


  I look forward to receive your hansom reply soonest.


  Yours faithfully,

  MR Ahbed Dialo.
