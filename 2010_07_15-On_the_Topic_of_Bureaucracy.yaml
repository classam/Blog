  articles expound endlessly on a topic that is completely and utterly ridiculous.</em>\n\nGood
  afternoon, the internet. I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of red tape and meetings,
  have just returned from a meeting on the topic of the Software Life Development
  Cycle.\n\nI don't want to toot my own horn, here, but I actually invented the Software
  Life Development Cycle in 1974, with the help of Fred Brooks, as a grand and elaborate
  prank.  Every time somebody goes through a pre-design-assessment-planning-architecture
  phase, I give Fred a call and we have a good chuckle.  Gotcha!\n\nBut I'm not here
  to talk about the SDLC.  That's another topic for a more rage-filled day. I'm just
  here to talk about bureaucracy.  In my last position (zeppelin mechanic), the rules
  were fast and loose.  I could show up to work whenever I wanted, finish some tasks,
  and then go home at the end of the day, secure in the knowledge that, while I might
  not have had any direct communication with my superiors, I still managed to get
  some solid zeppelin-repair done.  This worked well for me, because I secretly hate
  all human interaction that's not accompanied by hot wings and fun times.\n\nHowever,
  I've just recently changed jobs - I'm now the imaginary CEO of a large telecommunications
  concern - and the number of meetings I've been subjected to has shot way up into
  the double digits.  The worst part is that a small percentage of these meetings
  are meetings briefing me about the meetings that I'll have to attend once I'm actually
  working on meeting-laden projects, projects that will inevitably be for the purpose
  of helping employees to communicate - something not adequately accomplished through
  meetings.\n\nIn conclusion? \n\n<h3> Morning Tea & Muffin Solutions Deck </h3>\n\n<strong>Summary</strong>:
  Morning Tea & Muffin\n\n<strong>Technical Objectives</strong>: To go to Starbucks,
  and acquire a tea and muffin.\n\n<strong>Cost Estimate</strong>: 10 minutes (time),
  $5 (capital expenditure) (+-30%) \n\n<strong>Business Impact</strong>: The tea will
  provide much needed caffeine, whereas the muffin will provide nutrition and act
  as a mild stress relaxant.  In the attached cost analysis document, see that the
  time lost to Morning Tea & Muffin is gained back twofold in added productivity estimates.
  \n\n<strong>Risk Analysis</strong>: See attached form COLON-312.  Note that employees
  taking a long, unsanctioned midday bathroom break on a regular schedule may seriously
  affect productivity estimates.\n\n<strong>Alternatives Considered</strong>: Alternatives
  considered include Coffee (as a replacement for Tea) and Scone (as a replacement
  for Muffin), but have been rejected for the following reasons - Coffee throws the
  COLON-312 estimates well into 'unacceptable risk' territory, and Scones do not meet
  a number of Enterprise Breakfast Requirements as laid out by the Morning Beverage
  and Snack Architecture Team.  However, a long term project (Muffin & Tea Extension
  Project) is underway to estimate the business cost of producing our own muffins
  and tea in-house.  For more details, contact the In-House Snacking Development Department
  between the hours of 9AM and 3PM. \n\n<strong>Enterprise Breakfast Requirements
  Audit</strong>:\nSee attached documents EBRA-01 and EBRA-02.  In summary, both the
  Tea and Muffin fit well within existing Enterprise Breakfast Requirements Guidelines,
  including compliance with the recent Soft Breakfast Guidelines set forth by the
  International Committee of Breakfast Standards (ICBS). \n\n<strong>Stakeholders</strong>\nYou
