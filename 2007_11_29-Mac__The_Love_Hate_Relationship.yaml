  />\nI want a Mac.  They're sleek, sexy, and their operating system is.. neat.\n\nMac
  Os X Leopard has neat new <a title=\"Apple: Leopard Features\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html\">features</a>.
  \ I still don't feel comfortable with the Mac window-management paradigm, but I'm
  sure I could get the hang of it eventually.  Most of those features that they advertise
  on the site, I don't even care about.  Better dock? Meh. Cover flow? I don't even
  use Cover Flow in iTunes. Fancy stationary mail? I don't want my friends to punch
  my kidneys, so no thank you. Safari? Well, I'm a FireFox man, myself- but hey, they're
  actively developing it. (Ahem, ahem, <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001006.html\">Internet
  Explorer</a>. )  iChat? iCan't chat with people who don't have the software, yet,
  so you're really not that useful.  Spaces? I don't use them in Ubuntu, I won't use
  them in Leopard. \n\nI'll admit that some of the features in \"Stacks\" look cool,
  but the online jury is still out on that one.\n\nTime Machine? I prefer my (admittedly
  ad-hoc) backup scheme- identifying very-important-files and putting them in SubVersion
  repositories and/or saving them on my array of burnable media, portable hard drives,
  or ridiculously oversized DreamHost account.  99% of the files on my computer are
  not important files.  I'd love to see if they included the Time-Machine graphical
  bits in the API, though- wouldn't the Time Machine interface be a neat add-on for
  SubVersion?\n\nMac Os's 'Font' support really blows poor Windows out of the water.
  Live Partition Resizing is pretty cool, too. \n\nI know <a title=\"Curtis Lassam:
  Lost Windows User In The Country Of The Macs\" href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=73\">I've
  had some problems with the way Apple has done things in the past.</a>.  \n\nThe
  Mac development platform is sharp and snazzy, (<a title=\"Wikipedia: Cocoa API\"
  href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_(API)\">Cocoa</a>) and I want to play
  with it.  Python as a first-class development language? That's just a dream!  On
  top of that, somehow, the Mac's managed to find itself a special niche- people who
  are willing to pay money for software. There's a growing Mac development community,
  and they all seem to be charging money for their software. This is great for developers
  like me... and terrible for cheap bastards like me. (There's the \"Love-Hate\" bit.)
  I guess I'll just have to either find a good source of haX0red Mac software, start
  giving in and paying for $30 chunks of software (And $30 is a reasonable-enough
  price for something good), build it myself, or use free alternatives wherever possible.
  I'll probably adapt some odd combination of those four. \n\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Mac_mini_Intel_Core.jpg/250px-Mac_mini_Intel_Core.jpg\"
  alt=\"Mac Mini\" />\nThe price is high.  I have a laptop that already does everything
  I want it to, and I bought it for $600.  I have been in the market for a new Desktop
  computer though.. my existing desktop is so cheap and slow and short on memory that
  it's been relegated to a position as Ubuntu Samba-file-server.  Maybe a Mac Mini?
  I'd need to supplement the rather insufficient hard-drive space with a file-server,
  but as I established, I have one already.  Toss in a big cheap LCD monitor for increased
  joy, and we almost have a good desktop setup.  It feels like I'm paying a lot of
  money for 'small' that I don't need, though. It could be the size of a truck for
  all I care. Thing is, though, the Mini doesn't ship with Leopard just yet.  Let's
  give it some time, wait and see what we come up with. \n\nFinally, I'm a bit disappointed
  with the way that Apple supports it's older hardware.  It.. doesn't.  I recently
  acquired a Mac Powerbook G4 Titanium \"<a title=\"Wikipedia: Powerbook G4\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_G4#Revisions\">Mercury</a>\"-
  the oldest G4 Powerbook, released in 2001. \n<blockquote style=\"padding-left: 10px\">\nThis
  was the original iteration, featuring a 400 or 500 MHz PowerPC 7410 processor. It
  featured a 100 MHz FSB, 2 RAM slots (that took up to 512 MiB modules, allowing for
  a maximum of 1 GiB), and an ATI RAGE 128 Mobility graphics card (with 8 MiB of VRAM;
  running at 2x AGP). Discontinued in October of 2001.\n</blockquote>\n\nNow, this
  beast is a venerable 6-year-old- practically an eternity in laptop time.  Nevertheless,
  it's still useful for a number of potential purposes- portable web-browser and mail-checker
  and text-editor and DIVX watcher. Hey, that's almost all I do with computers anyways.
  The only problem is, it's battery is kaput, and it's CD/DVD drive is dead as a doornail.
  Asking an Apple Store representative how much it would cost to find a replacement
  battery, he politely informed me that Apple no longer supports anything so old.
  \ How disappointing.  \n\nI guess to resurrect the Powerbook, I'm going to need
  a bootable external CD-drive (so as to install Mac Os X Tiger) and some E-Bay-style
  battery hunting.  Anybody out there interested the dark arts of Powerbook resurrection?
  \n\nSo.. there are things I like and dislike about Apple and their softwares. I'll
  put some thought into that Mac Mini - I have time, while they decide to install
  Leopard on it, and maybe wait for the difference in Canadian and American prices
  to even out a bit (yeah, right.) \n\nFor now, though, I'm a Windows man. Maybe an
  Ubuntu man a bit, too. \n"
