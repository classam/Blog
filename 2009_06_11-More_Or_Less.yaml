  to the perhaps-less-popular \"More >>>\" system on my website.  What that means
  is that, on the front page of my website, instead of being faced with everything
  I've written for the past month or so, you instead get just an excerpt and a link
  to more.\n\nI did this, mostly because a select few of my posts have been very,
  very long.  I'm looking at you, <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=585\">Public
  Static Void Main Args</a>.  It can be troublesome to have to scroll through several
  pages of content when you're looking to go back a couple of pages looking for a
  specific blog post.\n\nThere are other reasons- I think that the excerpt model is
  a good one, providing users with a quick decision on whether or not to read the
  full article.  Wired does it, Cracked does it... it seems to make sense.  On a traditional
  blog, though, sometimes it's nice to just start <em>reading down</em> &mdash without
  having to page from article to article.  Coding Horror manages to make a successful
  blog out of only ever displaying one blog post at a time, although the articles
  there are guaranteed to be at least a page each, followed by all of the comments
  in the world. \n\nSo, the question is &mdash; which layout do you prefer, and why? "
