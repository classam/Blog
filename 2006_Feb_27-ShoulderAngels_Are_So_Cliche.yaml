  Okay, the old ''shoulder-angel/shoulder-devil'' thing is a bit overdone. It is fun,
  though.  For a while, I was thinking of doing a comic where a guy''s conscience,
  in the form of the shoulder angel and devil, became full-sized and could follow
  him around and interact with his life.  The trick was that the devil would enrich
  his life as much, if not more, as the angel, as he would be more concerned with
  pragmatic realities than tired old moral ideals.


  It sounded fun, at least.  This was from the ''tween-schools'' period between High
  School and University, if you''re looking for a generic time frame for this comic
  to fit into.


  This week, I''m working at the <a href="http://www.daysinnlangley.com/">hotel.</a>
  All week. I worked last week, too, Wednesday to Saturday, and now I''m working Monday
  to Friday, all 10-12 hour shifts.

  Oh, horrors. Horrors and pain!'
