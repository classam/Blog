  small - small enough that I'd be able to at least get the ball rolling in my spare
  time.  \n\nI'll put together UI sketches, do a quick Google search for the thing
  I'm planning on building,  plan out the infrastructure, maybe put together a elementary
  business plan... \n\nAnd it seems that, every single time, I run into a company
  that has built <em>exactly</em> the same thing that I was planning to build, <em>exactly</em>
  the same way that I would have planned to build it - and not just that, they've
  executed it better than I ever would have.  It runs faster and looks prettier.\n\nHere's
  an example. \n\nThere was a concept I was developing, for a general-purpose commenting
  system.  The main site would take a URI as an input and produce JSON comment output,
  using a key-value database to store blocks of comments data against hashed URI values.
  It would be RESTful, and it would be OpenID enabled.  I started thinking, seriously,
  about comments and communities, and how best to build a 'general purpose' system.
  \ It was going to make money by selling 'deluxe' and/or 'private' social networking
  features directly to companies. I was going to use Python and MongoDB.  People could
  link directly to the site for an already-built Javascript comment system, embed
  a variety of Javascript Comment Widgets into their website, or use the API's to
  custom-build their own commenting system.  \n\nThen, I would take the flexible comment
  system and use it to power social features on any other project that I build, ever,
  including my blog (via a plugin).  Rewriting my Comic Website without having to
  include comments makes it an afternoon project instead of a weeklong scrudge. Building
  a forum with a pre-built comment system as a back-end would be almost trivially
  easy.\n\nI thought of the name \"Annotatr\" for the software, but it seemed a bit
  long and academic.  What about \"Tatr\"? In nah, the \"somethingr\" website-naming
  craze would just make me a follower.  Okay, \"Potater\".  Hey - you can build a
  mash-up with Potater.  I liked it. Mashed potaters! Heh. \n\nOkay, so, I'm browsing
  the wedding site of a friend of mine, and he's added comments - now, he's more a
  Javascript developer than a backend dev, so instead of implementing it all himself,
  he's used a Javascript library called <a href=\"http://disqus.com/\">Disqus</a>.
  \ (Pronounce as \"Discuss\") \n\nDisqus, eh?  This all seems awfully familiar.  \n\nOh,
  it's... exactly the same thing that I was going to build. Except they've been working
  on it for months, and they're a lot further along than I was - they've not only
  got the complete framework down, they've also built plugins for all of the major
  blogs, they've got the API done, and everything has that 'we have a graphic designer'
  sheen. \n\nOkay, well, at least they didn't build it exactly the same way that I
  was going to build it.  I look into MongoDB anyways, reading about how to install
  it, how to deploy it... and on the list of \"Successful MongoDB\" deployments, there
  it is. Fucking Disqus.  Come on, the same DB that I wanted to use? \n\nOkay, there's
  no WAY that they built it in Python.  Come on, why would they do that?  Ruby on
  Rails is the popular web development framework! PHP is the 'standard' web development
  framework! Java is the 'enterprisey' web development framework!  Python is just
  for errant hackers and retards who like whitespace! (Like me) \n\nOh frig frig doublefrig.
  They built it in Django.  Okay, I'm out.  No way I'm going to build this thing if
  somebody else has already built it, the same way that I would have built it, with
  the same architecture, the same database and the same programming language. Darn.
  \n\nSo, that's my most recent adventure in \"somebody already built it.\" - but
  not my first.  No, it's happened to me semi-regularly. \n\nAbout a 8 months ago,
  a Google search for \"Online Portfolio\" (and here I mean an 'art' or 'web' portfolio,
  nothing financial)  turned up a handful of scrubs with terrible websites.  My idea,
  <em>PortfoliOlio</em>, was going to be a slick, sexy, portfolio manager. My portfolio
  wouldn't just be a collection of websites that I'd worked on - it would be, in and
  of itself, the best damn free portfolio manager on the market.  Heck, other people
  could even use it- and if they wanted to get a full-featured portfolio, they could
  pay, a bit.\n\nThere were UI mockups, again, and basic architectural planning -
  most of my 'architecturing' is just to draw out how I imagine the database looking
  and what language and software packages I plan to use to build the software.  Once
  you have that, you're all set, the rest of the software just falls into place. \n\nEnter
  <a href=\"http://www.carbonmade.com/\">CarbonMade</a>.  They weren't even on the
  Google radar when I first searched for them, but I ran into them by searching for
  every combination of \"Free\", \"Online\", and \"Portfolio\" that I could find -
  and I wasn't expecting much, given the crop of 2001 'web portal' hackery I encountered.
  \ Eventually, I found CarbonMade, and, heck, the software even looked the way that
  I'd imagined it - but better.  The login-button is a friggin' <em>moustache</em>.
  The sign-up button is guarded by an octopus in a tie and top hat, and the site's
  logo is a girlicorn.  It's aggressively stylish, slick, and sexy. It's <em>exactly</em>
  what I wanted to build.  \n\nAnd now, they're the number-two Google result for \"Online
  Portfolio\", and they're kicking ass.  \n\nI guess I just have to have these ideas
  faster.  "
