  articles are highly compressed versions of semi-important things that I've read.
  </em> \n\n<h3> Saying \"No\" </h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/no-one-nos-learning-to-say-no-to-bad-ideas/\">Here</a>\n\n<h4>Reasons
  to Say No:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li> Kill a bad idea. </li>\n<li> Keep a project on time/budget
  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Ways to Say No: </h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cite Best Practices:</strong>
  Educate your customers. If everybody else is doing it, it's probably for a reason.
  </li> \n<li><strong>Use Data:</strong> Gather data. Authoritative-sounding numbers
  are convincing. </li>\n<li><strong>Use Price:</strong> Quote a price for the bad
  feature. A high price. </li>\n<li> <strong>Who's Using It?</strong> Usability testing
  from 'potential customers' is a good way to squelch bad ideas, as stakeholders visibly
  see the customers struggling to understand the features. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4> Cushioning
  the Blow: </h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Yes-No-Yes: </strong> \"Yes! It's a good idea
  to try to <em>blah</em>!\" - \"No, that's probably not a very good way to do it.\"
  - \"Yes! Let's try to think of better ways to do that!\"</li>\n<li><strong>Wait:
  </strong> Think carefully before you 'no'. </li>\n<li><strong>Plan B: </strong>
  What if they don't accept your 'no'? What then? </li>\n<li><strong>Same Data, Same
  Conclusion: </strong> Instead of saying no, give stakeholders the same data that
  you used to come to the 'no', and let them come to your decision. </li>\n<li><strong>Less
  is More: </strong> A short, well-expressed reason why something is a bad idea handily
  beats a multi-page treatise. </li>\n</ul>\n"
