  alt=\"This is a font that I made, \nout of my handwriting.\nI plan to use it mostly
  for\ncomics (LIKE THIS!) - although\nit's not a bad script font.\nI could also use
  it as a\nwhiteboard-style font- just\nadd some colour and use it for\ncode or something.\nIt
  still needs some work- the \npercent sign isn't working for \nsome reason, and I
  don't like \nthe way that the g sits\nheavy on the top and light on \nthe bottom.
  \nThe Â© sign is also going to be\nflipped around to make a \ncopyleft symbol. (HA!)
  Also, it's currently installing\nas untitled, when it's \noperating name is Sharpy\n-
  although I might change\nthe name to something\na little bit more me, like\nLASSAM
  SCRIPT or \nLASSAM SCRIPT ULTRABOLD\nor Myriad Pro. \nYou know, if none of those\nare
  already taken.\nWhen it's done (Friday, maybe)\nyou can download it, for free\nfrom
  me, under a Creative\nCommons Do-Whatever-The-\nHell-You-Want-With-It\nFree-As-In-Beer
  License.\n\n\\o/ - Curtis Lassam  \" > </img>"
