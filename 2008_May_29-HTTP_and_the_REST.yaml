  470</acronym>, <a title="Greg Baker" href="http://gregbaker.ca/blog/">our professor</a>
  has been delivering an assortment of HTTP-related lessons.


  This is actually proving to be mighty interesting- Apache and basic <acronym title="Hypertext
  Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> have a lot of features that I never knew they
  had.


  It''s also managing to be pretty interesting- because the <acronym title="Representational
  State Transfer">REST</acronym> web-service architecture is so closely tied to HTTP,
  all of the stuff we''re learning almost directly applies to some architecturing
  I''m doing at work.'
