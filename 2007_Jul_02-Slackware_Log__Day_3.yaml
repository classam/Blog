  href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=218\">Slackware Log - Day 1</a>\n\n35. Okay,
  so it's day three of ye olde' Slack log.  I'm still having that trouble where KDE
  doesn't really understand how 1280x800 works, and instead just scrolls a 1026x768
  screen around a 1280x800-sized display (which is odd, let me tell you!).\n\n36.
  XFCE seems to be working okay, though, and it's lightning fast (because it's XFCE).
  Firefox still takes a while to load, and it was Firefox 1.5 (Boo!). First things
  first- upgrade Firefox. \n\n37. Download Firefox. \n\n37. Remember <a href=\"http://www.getswiftfox.com/\">Swiftfox</a>!
  It's Firefox, but optimized for Linux+x86!\n\n38. Install Swiftfox (Intel Celeron
  M version.) No compilation necessary, the binaries are included.  Put Swiftfox in
  /usr/lib/swiftfox/, then symlink /usr/bin/swiftfox and /usr/bin/firefox to it. \n\n39.
  Hot dog, this is the fastest FireFox ever! It's like FireFox on the crack-cocaine!
  Yay speedy browsing experience! \n\n40. Okay, I want to watch a movie or something.
  My codecs aren't set up. I could spend some time setting them up or... \n\n41. Switch
  back to Windows, watch some movies. Thus ends the (very short) Day 3.\n\n<EDIT:
  This was the last Slackware Log- I eventually decided to just go back to good ol'
  Ubuntu. 7.10 is a fantastic release. >"
