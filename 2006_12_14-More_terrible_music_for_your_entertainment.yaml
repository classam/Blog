  Carlito Carlito" was formed with three out of four members of a basement band originally
  named "The Moon Patrol". It all started with two keyboards and a three string guitar.
  Today "Carlito Carlito Carlito" is more streamline but we still like to keep it
  pretty raw. The concept for our most recent album was based on a book called "The
  Diceman" by Luke Rhineheart. Essentially we rolled dice to choose the style, genre,
  tempo etc of each song on the album from a random list of option. The result was
  a mix of rap, country, folk ballads and a touch of death metal.</font>


  </em>Yes, they roll dice to determine what they''ll play next.
