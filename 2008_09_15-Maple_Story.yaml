  of Nexon</a> in the near future, I was thinking that I might take a look at one
  of their most popular(/advertised) online properties, Maple Story.\n\nIf I had to
  describe the game in two words?  Poorly translated. \n\nI can't even begin to enumerate
  the almost-but-not-quite-syntactically-correct-English in the game.  It's just a
  step above Zero Wing in terms of translation quality.  \n\nYou start off with the
  MMO-standard almost-nothing-at-all. Here's your undershirt, shorts, and wooden sword.
  Go kill snails a bit. \n\nAs for the user base, it seems to be composed entirely
  of the 8-12-year-old crowd, a bunch of whiny, immoral, \"r u goin 2 mk fun my bff
  wh0re?\" sort of crew that so nauseates me. \n\nI had some fun attempting to perform
  a trade with someone while pretending to have no concept of what 'trading' is, how
  one might perform such a trade, what 'money' is, what value it might have, that
  sort of thing. ('r u stupid?' \"No, I'm just having trouble understanding the concept-
  in exchange for 2000 arrows, you will give me... money? What is this.. 'money'?\"
  'it's MONEY!' \"Yes, yes, saying it louder won't make it any clearer\"...)\n\nThe
  game itself is pretty standard MMO fare- hit things about the head and neck in exchange
  for points, tiny amounts of money, and countless tiny MacGuffins (\"Bring me 281,092,102
  horbongler pelts!\") \n\nThe game doesn't seem to have any appreciable draw- the
  community is too downright young for anybody with armpit hair, the gameplay is simple
  and slow and boring, and .. wait, I just thought of the game's one saving grace-
  the game's appearance is lively and animated.  So there's that.  I suppose if you
  toss a nice ribbon on a pig, you have ... one of the game's early enemies. \n\n<img
