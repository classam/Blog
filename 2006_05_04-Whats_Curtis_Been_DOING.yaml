content: ! 'Okay, Curtis has been absent for some time. Why? First, the Peak Retreat
  (featured in the last post). Then, the day after The Peak Retreat?


  <b>The FAS Formal</b>


  Oh, the FAS Formal was a jolly time. A time, marked by how jolly it was. High in
  it&#39;s level of jollitude. Jolli.. okay, moving on, &#39;twas a formal dinner
  put on by the Faculty of Applied Sciences. I dragged Kristen along, not knowing
  quite how much trouble she would eventually have to expend to prepare herself for
  the formal dinner.

  <h2>Camping</h2>


  The next day, Kristen and I went camping. Cultus Lake. &#39;Twas a merry time. First,
  shopping for Camping Goods, like &quot;Marshmallows&quot; and &quot;Cereal&quot;
  and &quot;Ravioli&quot;. Then? Road driving trippy thing.During the trip, I encountered
  an unusual bumper sticker that I had to share with the world.

  Darn thievin&#39; Llamas.


  Afterwards? Camp-setting-up-time. Oh, and rain. Day 1 was bringing with &quot;The
  Rain&quot;. Drizzly, constant but light soggitude.

  Fortunately, I had the foresight to put TARPS EVERYWHERE!

  The tent still got a little soggy &#39;round the edges, though. Silly me, not thinking
  about where the top-tarp would drain off...

  Concurently, on Day 1, I couldn&#39;t light any of the damn camp equipment. Pressurize,
  damn you! Pressurize!

  Day 2 had breakfast (Mmm, hashbrowns, bacon, and eggs), lunch (Mmm, sammitches)
  and me *totally trouncing* Kristen at two games of &quot;Ten Days In Europe&quot;.

  By the end of the day, I had discovered how to operate the various gas-powered contrivances
  I had brought along. Yay lantern and campstove!

  The next morning? Breakfast of champions! (Cereal and PB &amp; J) Then, we left
  for home.

  Home, where we put all of the camp stuff away.. and prepared for..

  <h2>The <a href="http://csss.cs.sfu.ca/">CSSS</a> LAN Party</h2>

  I brought a bag of Supersize Mr. Big bars, and an 8-pack of Monster Energy Drinks,
  all provided by my father who works at Wallace &amp; Carey (The supplier for 7:11)..
  see, some of the cans of Monster were shaped like they had been beaten repeatedly
  with a baseball bat. Still good, though! Mmm, damaged goods.


  Marcel demonstrated his awesome chocolate deep-throating abilities.

  Yes, this man is a Vice President. Just like me.

  Oh, and it turns out, this LAN party was in no way about The LAN.

  This was the entire LAN contingent of the LAN party. Whoa. They packed up pretty
  quickly.

  No, the games we played..were.. revolutionary.

  Oh, yes, Dance Dance Revolution. Awesome. So very awesome.

  Oh, and that other Revolution. The Karaoke one.

  I don&#39;t like that one.

  I sang, and they booed me off the stage (the game persons) in less than 20 seconds.

  Boo!

  Also? We played Mafia, The Chairman&#39;s Game, and &quot;Super-Multi-Frisbee&quot;.
  And Noah on a Unicycle. A Unoahcycle.



  So, after the LAN party (the next morning) we went home, had breakfast at North
  Van&#39;s famous <a href="http://www.tomahawkrestaurant.com/index.htm?main.htm&amp;2">Tomahawk</a>
  restaurant, and went searching for a DVD copy of <a href="http://orangecow.org/pythonet/scripts/Holy_Grail_Film_Script.txt">Monty
  Python And  The Holy Grail</a> that I could buy. I, of course, want the 2-DVD special
  edition- But after frequenting 2 Rogers&#39; Video, 1 Blockbuster, a London Drugs,
  and a Future Shop, I didn&#39;t find any Grail. No grail at all. It was so depressing!


  I spent the night with Kristen, in the morning we watched Howl&#39;s Moving Castle
  (Awesome!) and I got a ride to the Quay, where I missed the Seabus and instead ate
  a fantastic burger (&quot;Gourmet&quot;, even). Skytrain home, work at hotel for
  two nights. Then, I moved on to


  <h2>Tuesday</h2>


  Wherein I had only one sleepy responsibility (Why sleepy? The Hotel job is a night
  shift- I finish at 7:00 AM) - to drag myself to the Peak Editor&#39;s Meeting. So,
  I manage to get about 3 hours of sleep, drag myself to the bus, and it&#39;s really
  busy! Why is a bus so busy on a Tuesday afternoon? The 502 takes a good 15 minutes
  longer than usual, and I eventually arrive 20 minutes late to the Editor&#39;s meeting.
  When I arrive, I discover that the meeting is, in fact, over. So, now I&#39;ve wasted
  a 2 hour trip for nothin&#39;.

  But wait!

  I encountered Noah, president of the CSSS, and he dragged me along to Greg Baker&#39;s farewell at the Mountain
  Shadow Pub. Fun was had- Greg Baker is a young professor, one of the ones who hasn&#39;t
  become horribly jaded by the position (only a little jaded). Not only were there
  lots of CSSS goons there, a few Peakies showed up, as well. I don&#39;t know why,
  but there seems to be a close relationship between the Peak and the CSSS, and I
  have no idea why.  Jen and Amanda have to fight over me, being that I&#39;m Jen&#39;s
  VPA and Amanda&#39;s Humour Editor. Gasp! As long as I get all the work done, I&#39;ll
  be fine.

  That night, went to Dan&#39;s and watched The Daily Show, then took the bus up to
  SFU and rolled out my sleeping bag on one of the couches.


  Yes, I was the villain who made an impromptu curtain between the Common Room and
  CSIL.


  Wednesday

  So, the next morning, I woke up feeling sick. Sore throat, runny nose, the works.
  Yes, the &#39;dusty old couch effect&#39; (Wherein every time I sleep on a couch
  that is dusty and old, I wake up with a cold) is still in full effect. I wandered
  to the Bookstore and the Library.  I decided to work up my gumption and drop CMPT
  310 (Artificial Intelligence) in favour of taking it next semester.

  I switched it out with CMPT 371 (Networking), being taught by some inexperienced
  new professor, Joshua Ber-something-Oppenheim.  I read his Curriculum Vitae and
  Teaching Portfolio, and it doesn&#39;t seem like he has any experience with the
  subject, and not too much teaching experience.. but that&#39;s about the same as
  what I&#39;ve gathered of all the Non-Bradley-Bart Profs during the summer semester.


  Then, I came home, and ate dinner at Montanas. And Olive Garden. Yay 2 sets of parents!'
