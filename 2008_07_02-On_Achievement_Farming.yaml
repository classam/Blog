  little badges that you can get on the Xbox 360 and on Steam (mostly on the Xbox
  360), for performing certain tasks in video games.\n\n<img title=\"Look away, Gnome,
  look away.\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2122/1580618259_95d00dc807.jpg\"
  alt=\"Garden Gnome\" />\n\nIf you manage to carry a Garden Gnome all the way through
  Half Life 2, for example, you get a somewhat rare <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/gaming/easter-eggs/playing-through-half+life-2-episode-two-with-a-gnome-312180.php\">achievement</a>.\n\n<img

  Achievement\" />\n\nNow, one thing that Team Fortress 2 has to offer, is a lot of
  achievements.  There are 17 that came with the game, and then, in free expansions,
  39 for the <a href=\"http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Medic\">Medic</a> and 38 for the <a
  href=\"http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Pyro\">Pyro</a>.  \n\nThat's great! I love achievements!
  It makes a victory all the more sweet to get that victory, and then be informed
  that you've killed a grand total of 100 enemies.  You even get a cute little badge.\n\nBut
  here's the problem- Valve has included new weapons with the achievement packs.  They
  change the game ever-so-slightly for the players.  Pyros can replace their shotgun
  with a flare-gun, Medics can leech life in a vampiric sort of way... but you can
  only get these new weapons when you get a certain number of achievements. \n\nSo
  instead of people amassing achievements organically, over time, people have set
  up \"Achievement Farms\" online, the whole purpose of which is to get people all
  of the achievements as quickly as possible.  \n\nThis makes the achievements less
  fun- all of a sudden, instead of lighting people on fire because you're a borderline
  pyromaniac with an itchy trigger finger, you start lighting people on fire because
  it's your job.\n\nWell, I'm going to get my achievements the old fashioned way-
  by lighting tonnes of people on fire.  It's more fun that way.  And if you light
  me on fire with one of your snazzy, achievement-farmed Pyro weapons? Well, you can
  eat my ass. "
