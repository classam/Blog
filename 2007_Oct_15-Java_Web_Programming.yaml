content: Once there was a horse tied up on the side of the street. Whenever someone
  tried to pass, the horse would kick them. Soon a crowd gathered around the horse
  until a wise man was seen coming close. The people said “This horse will surely
  kill anyone who tries to pass. What are we going to do?” The wise man looked at
  the horse, turned and walked down another street.
