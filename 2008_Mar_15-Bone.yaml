  but it's a great read.  \n\n<blockquote>Mere months after publishing the final installment
  of the long-running fantasy saga Bone, Smith collects all 13 years' worth of it
  in a single, massive volume. As many comics fans know, the series chronicles the
  adventures of the Bone cousins--plucky Fone Bone, scheming Phony Bone, and easygoing
  Smiley Bone-- who leave their home of Boneville and are swept up in a Tolkienesque
  epic of royalty, dragons, and unspeakable evil forces out to conquer humankind.
  The compilation makes it evident how fully formed Smith's vision was from the very

  style, in the manner of such comics masters as Walt Kelly and Carl Barks, was fully
  formed from the start, too </blockquote>\n\nBone is clever, funny, dramatic, and
  the story arc holds together well. So.. go buy it. Do it now! "
