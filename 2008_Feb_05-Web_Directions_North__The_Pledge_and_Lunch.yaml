  alt=\"Kimberly Elam\" />The second presentation after the keynote was by Kimberley
  Elam. \"Five Essential Composition Tools for Web Typography\".  While Allen was
  a little less enthused- it was nothing new- I was rapt.  While I've picked a little
  bit of design goodness out of books like \"<a title=\"Jim Krause: Design Basics
  Index\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Design-Basics-Index-Jim-Krause/dp/1581805012\">Design
  Basics Index</a>\", the \"<a title=\"Robin Williams: Non-Designers Design Book\"
  href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-Robin-Williams/dp/0321534042/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1202250882&sr=1-1\">Non-Designers
  Design Book</a>\", and \"<a title=\"Steve Krug: Don't Make Me Think\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1202250945&sr=1-1\">Don't
  Make Me Think</a>\", this whole presentation was a different way of looking at it.
  \n\nWe started with the Pledge of Typography:\n<blockquote>\nI will not squish or
  stretch type.\n\nI will not outline type.\n\nI will not stack type.\n\nI will use
  prime marks and quote marks appropriately.\n\nI will appropriately use hyphens,
  en-dashes, and em-dashes.\n\nI will honor the classic families of type- Baskerville,
  Bodoni, Helvetica, Times, Caslon, Century, Serifa, and Garamond. \n\nI pledge not
  to commit crimes against typography.\n</blockquote>\n\nAfter that, we went into
  a slightly-less interesting discussion about Content Organization, which failed
  to blow me away.\n\nThen, a look at visual organization with a few interesting grid
  layouts as examples.  The examples given were the sites for <a href=\"http://www.pentagram.com/en/\">Pentagram
  Design</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/index.php/\">TED</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.samatamason.com/main.asp\">SamataMason</a>,
  with a discussion of some peripheral concepts like eyeflow and proportion. \n\nOne
  of the concepts during the presentation that I found really interesting was that
  constraints can breed creativity.  This struck me as immediately both true and a
  fantastic idea.  There is nothing more alarming than a blank screen- but once you
  set a constraint for yourself, things start to flow. It has to be blue, and no wider
  than 700px.  It has to be in one font, and you can only use one colour. So with
  constraints come creativity. \n\nFinally, and here I'm looking at the smattering
  of rules that I had taken as notes, a couple of rules of good typographic practice.
  \n\n<blockquote>\nThe line-length of a paragraph is important to readability- too
  long or too short and it gets difficult to deal with.  8-11 words per line is about
  optimal.\n\nPlain backgrounds produce faster text-search times. \n\nDark text on
  a light background is the most readable combination.\n\nMixed-upper-and-lowercase
  text is the easiest to read.\n\nWatch out for coloured text on a coloured background-
  colour blindness can render these words invisible. \n</blockquote>\n\nAnd that's
  it for that presentation.\n\nAfter the presentation, we had lunch at the Hyatt.
  \ This was one of those semi-fancy food buffets that you always eat at halls and
  hotels, office-function food.  Salads, starches, and a few trays containing assorted
  meaty products. \n\nI found the meal unbalanced, as buffet food almost always ends
  up being.  Offering up so many choices- say, a stuffed ravioli next to a southwestern-style
  flank steak- just seems to colour the whole meal a bland gray.  The meal was not
  memorable. \n\nMore tomorrow!"
