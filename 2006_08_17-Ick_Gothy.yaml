  comic</a>, and I''m trying to decide whether to enjoy it or just be irritated.


  See, ''cause it''s at heartshapedskull.com, and the whole thing is just so.. ''emo''.
  Ick.

  I mean, this is the whole thing that <a href="http://www.samandfuzzy.com/">Sam Logan</a>
  was mocking with his "<a href="http://www.samandfuzzy.com/archive.php?id=322">Skull
  Panda Loves Kitties</a>" concept.


  On the other hand, the main character just defended turnips. That''s so a plus.


  I''ll give it a few months to pan out, we''ll see how if it gets better or worse.
