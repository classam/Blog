content: ! "I just stopped at Amazon and purchased _all of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmetropolitan\">Transmetropolitan</a>_.
  This fills me with deep joy, but there's this thing that I just can't stand - compilations
  are always so expensive.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_City\">Sin
  City</a> ran me a solid $120, with Transmetropolitan at the same price point. \n\nDo
  you know how much the entire series of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_%28comics%29\">Bone</a>
  cost? $35. Of course, it's all black-and-white, so it's hard to directly compare,
  but ... still... large comic compliations are expensive, dammit.  Finishing my Sandman
  collection is probably going to run a solid $200, and let's not even go into collecting
  print works of <a href=\"http://www.harkavagrant.com/\">great webcomics</a> before
  they <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Hall\">go out of print</a> or <a
  href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexy_Losers\">drop off the internet for large
  chunks of time</a>."
