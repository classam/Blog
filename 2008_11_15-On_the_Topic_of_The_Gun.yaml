  So, you''ve got your gun pointed at the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Series
  Villain</a> - often a homicidal maniac.  He has the gun pointed at the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">innocent
  love-interest</a>.


  At this point he yells out "Put the gun down, or I''ll shoot her!", often followed
  by some sort of "Now get on the ground" schtick.


  Now, at this point, the hero always puts his gun down.  Now, by my reckoning, the
  villain (a homicidal maniac) has a gun and both the innocent love-interest and the
  hero are unarmed and in a vulnerable state.  This seems like a negative outcome.


  Remember kids: If you''re in a cliche, don''t play it straight. Keep the gun. '
