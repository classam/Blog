  a movie that's based on a book, I read the book first, then watch the movie and
  internally flinch at every cut scene and every plot deviation. \n\nAll movies make
  creative cuts and alterations to the source material- to render the story even remotely
  watchable.\n\nSome movies- say, V for Vendetta, or The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen-
  just don't cut their lines close enough to the plot of the original.  They go in
  strange directions, mangling themes and achieving a good Hollywood Ending at the
  expense of their soul.\n\nSome movies achieve a good balance between source material
  and Hollywood - the Harry Potter movies and Lord of the Rings come to mind. They
  maintain much of the integrity of the original while simplifying the plotlines and
  cooking the result down to something that will work on screen.\n\nSome movies, however,
  are _too_ faithful to the source material.  The Golden Compass, for example.  Maintaining
  the plot of the original story, the poor director tried to cram the whole story
  in to an insufficient amount of time, racing through the important scenes and leaving
  innumerable unexplained occurrences and unresolved plot threads.  Even with large
  cuts made to the original story, there's just no way to fit everything that happened
  in the book into a couple of hours of movie.  \n\nI'd have to say that Watchmen
  found it's way into the third category.  For people who've read the original, it's
  spot on in it's accuracy, a spectacular rendition of an interesting and deep story.
  \ There are a few logical inconsistencies, the worst sex scene in the recent history
  of cinema, and some minor botchings- but it's easy to forget these shortcomings
  when faced with a perfect rendition of one of the main characters' <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/CrowningMomentOfAwesome?from=Main.CrowningMomentOfAwesome\">Crowning
  Moments of Awesome</a>.  \n\nFor people who haven't read the book, it's slow, plodding,
  confusing, violent, morally obscure, and strange, with the themes of the book murkily
  failing to really make themselves clear.\n\nThe verdict is simple. Read the book
  first.  Then read the book again.  When you watch the movie, you'll marvel in the
  fine details and clean storytelling of a tale you already know.  The details- Hollis
  Mason's garage, Dollar Bill, the Gunga Diner - they're spot on, and your inner fanboy
  will revel at every carefully crafted detail. \n\nBut, for the love of god, don't
  watch it without reading the book first.  "
