content: ! 'Yes, it''s time for me to once-again attempt to fit myself into the spot
  of Humour Editor at The Peak.  I say ''vote for me'', even though I have no idea
  who I am running against. (I''m going to check the board on Tuesday, ''next time
  I''m at SFU).


  The thing is, Warren Haas isn''t running.  This is good for me, because, even though
  I have been critical of him in the past, he is a quite capable humour editor.  I
  didn''t win running against him last time, and I probably wouldn''t win running
  against him this time.'
