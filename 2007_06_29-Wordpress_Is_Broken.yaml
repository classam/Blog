  Apparently, there''s a bug in Wordpress that causes the WYSIWYG editor, TinyMCE,
  to ''not work at all''.


  Now, the funny thing is, I almost didn''t notice.

  See, the not-so-rich text editor, the ''plain ol'' code editor'', in my opinion,
  is actually.. much better. It has a bunch of common html shortcuts to save time,
  and everything that goes into the box is HTML code.


  I like it better that way.


  The text-only view (Which I am restricted to, apparently) is smaller, more convenient,
  and handles spacing in a way that is clear and understandable. So, while a fix may
  be available for my specific problem, I think I''ll be keeping it like this for
  a while.'
