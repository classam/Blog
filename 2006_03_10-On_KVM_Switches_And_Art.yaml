  What is a KVM switch, you may ask? (Okay, CS guys, you already know.)

  It''s a switch that allows me to run two computers from one keyboard, mouse, and
  monitor.

  It also means that I have a chance to cram -ever-the-more- cords and bits of computer
  equipment under my desk.

  So, now, instead of dual-booting Linux and Windows, I can just switch between the
  two.

  My glee at this, when I appeared on the CSSS IRC, was immediately ripped to shreds
  by Chris Demwell, who has had some bad experiences with KVM switches, being that
  they don''t do anything that he wants them to do.


  See that design on the side of the bigger, older computer?

  Yeah, I spent at least a couple of hours working on that. I burnt out two sharpies!

  Wanna see?

  No?


  Well you have to, anyways. Nyah!
