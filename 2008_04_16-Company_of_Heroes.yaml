  Here's an image to illustrate why: \n\n<img src=\"http://www.superdickery.com/images/oneshot/batman07.jpg\"
  alt=\"Boner of the year!\" />\n\nWait, not that one.  Well, Let's just say that
  the game is addictive, but the single-player mode rapidly loses 'spice' as it starts
  to become too easy- once you've established a foothold and have a hold on the pattern
  of push forward, fortify, replace lost units, push forward, fortify, replace lost
  units, etc.., it starts to become a bit monotonous. \n\nInitially, creating a safe
  haven for your troops is difficult and fun, but at some point you're just rolling
  across the map, performing tedious mop-up operations.  Part of this may be because
  of my exceeding thoroughness. Capture every point, fortify the hell out of everything,
  set up camp, be safe, etcetera.  The unit caps- which are rather low- at least keep
  things from getting too easy- at some point in a scenario you can replace troops
  as fast as they die, but if you play your cards poorly they're still going to die
  by the truckload and territory might even be lost. \n\nNot too monotonous, mind
  you- I've managed to seep a good 6 hours or so out of it, and I wouldn't be too
  adverse to going back for some more.  \n\nThe game captures the theme well, all
  of the guns sound different and your troops give you useful information. (\"Engineers
  are under fire!\") It feels a lot like someone watched Saving Private Ryan or Band
  of Brothers and said \"I want to do THAT.\"  I'm still not a fan of the World War
  2 theme- it's an unimaginative, safe way to go about things. \n\nCompany of Heroes
  definitely feels like another Relic RTS- You can almost feel the Dawn of War roots.
  The tech-tree and base-building aspects, however, are heavily de-emphasized in favour
  of squad-level tactics (Fortify that building! We need an armored division in here
  now!). The 'combat' part of the game is MUCH stronger than in the Dawn of War series.
  The battle animations are there in their full glory- less creative however, because
  in WWII there were explosions and bullets- no giant walking avatars of death. The
  amount of thought that needs to go into a balanced attack is so much more than just
  pumping out units and throwing them at the enemy defenses- which, of course, would
  lead to a humiliating loss. \nCover, chokepoints, and the construction of de-facto
  defenses (sandbags, mines, tank-traps, gun emplacements...)  make the game far more
  fluid.\n\nI haven't even TRIED multiplayer yet.  Nobody I know owns the game, and
  people online are (as a guideline) total douchehats. This is, you see, why I'm trying
  to get you into the game. I need opponents. Come to me! *gwa ha ha*"
