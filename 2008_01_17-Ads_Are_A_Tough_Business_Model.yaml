content: ! "About 2 months ago, I was curious about how much money could be made using
  Google Ads, so I installed it.\n\nNow, let's quickly take a look at my site's audience.
  I get about 30 people a day arriving at my site the traditional way.  As for RSS,
  well, I haven't installed Feedburner and thus have no information whatsoever about
  who reads my RSS feed, but I'll assume it's a million bajillion people for the sake
  of my own ego.  I also, occasionally, get moderately high on programming.reddit.com,
  if anything because tonnes of people disagree with everything that I've ever said.
  \ Over the last 2 months, I've had about 6000 hits to my site.  In that same period
  of time, I've had exactly 2 people click on the Google Ads.  Both of those people
  were (unfortunately) me, curious about something that appeared on one of my own
  ads. \"What? An awesome garlic bread? Hells yeah I'm interested in that!\" \n\nThis
  has earned me exactly $0.26. At this rate, I would need over 200,000 visitors per
  month to my website in order to pay for the basic web-hosting package that I use.
  \n\nThis is, of course, an entirely unsupportable business model. Fortunately, it's
  not a business for me, it's a hobby- but if I were planning on an ad-supported project,
  I'd clearly have to re-evaluate my strategy. Let's look at some of the reasons my
  Google ads aren't making any money.\n\n<b> 1. Nobody Pays Attention To Google Ads
  </b>\n\nGoogle Ads are the most ignored things on the internet.  When I was applying
  for a job at Research In Motion, I couldn't find some critical aspects of their
  job-application GUI because they were in a box, in big blue text, with smaller gray
  text underneath. They looked just like Google Ads and I didn't see them because
  I've trained my mind to studiously ignore anything that looks even remotely like
  a Google ad.  Most experienced internet users either have a service blocking out
  the advertisements or just pay zero attention to them.\n\n<b> 2. Google Ads Don't
  Pay That Well </b>\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Google Ads are an easy-way-out,
  an automatic advertising system.  A better alternative might be, say, <a href=\"http://www.projectwonderful.com/sellingads.php\">Project
  Wonderful</a>, a boon to the Web-comic world. Perhaps some sort of affiliate program
  with <a href=\"http://www.bustedtees.com/affiliates\">one of the many T-Shirt vendors</a>,
  or heck, even <a href=\"http://www.dreamhost.com/hosting-rewards.html\">hawking
  DreamHost accounts</a>.  I know I've recommended a few people get DreamHost accounts-
  I could be making money from you guys!  \n\nA much more profitable system is where
  you individually interface with advertisers to offer more specialized content that
  might actually be of interest to people on your website- Penny Arcade is able to
  make a lot of money just by being very selective about their advertising, to the
  point where getting an ad on their site is a huge recommendation that a lot of people
  will take very seriously.  <a href=\"http://jobs.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?pg=pgPostJob\">JoelOnSoftware</a>
  and <a title=\"TheDailyWTF actually just resells HiddenNetwork ads.\" href=\"http://hiddennetwork.com/\">TheDailyWTF</a>
  both sell advertising space to companies looking for qualified tech staff.  Specialized
  advertising requires, however, a large and very focused audience.\n\n<b> 3. The
  Ads On My Site Don't Stand Out </b>\nI'm more concerned with not irritating people
  and maintaining unity-of-design than I am of, say, ad revenues.  I don't think this
  is too much of a problem, though- thanks to Item 1 up there, my whole site could
  be Google Ad and few would notice.\n\n<b> 4. Redditors and Diggers don't click on
  ads. </b>\nPeople arriving from <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com\">link-aggregators</a>
  are not exactly model netizens. They come in to your website, make a big mess, use
  up all of your bandwidth, then leave.  They don't stick around long enough to get
  to know the site, they don't post comments, and they never click on ads.  The only
  way to keep people from Reddit or Digg at your site is to consistently offer interesting
  articles - Coding Horror and XKCD make it to the front page of Reddit on a regular
  basis just because of their name brands and consistently high quality.  Of my 6000
  hits, 5000 of them stopped by, maybe read half of the article that I posted, and
  then disappeared, looking for a something new and interesting somewhere else.\n\nThis
  all leads me to my conclusion:  In order to make any sort of money from a website,
  you need a large, tightly-focused audience, and well-thought-out advertising.  Otherwise
  you'll end up with exactly 26 cents.\n"
