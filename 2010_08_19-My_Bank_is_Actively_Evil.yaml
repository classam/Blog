content: ! 'Royal Bank online banking now provides an extra feature - the ability
  to see a breakdown of expenses by category.  "Food, telephone, entertainment..."  One
  category is notably excluded from the list, however - ''Bank Fees''.  It''s hidden
  in a grey pie-slice called ''Other Expenses''.  Nice.  '
