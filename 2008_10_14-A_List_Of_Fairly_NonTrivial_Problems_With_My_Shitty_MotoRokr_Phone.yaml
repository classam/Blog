content: ! "<ul>\n<li> If the button-lock isn't on (it rarely is) my phone - a chocolate-bar,
  not a clam-shell - will do random things in my pants.  Such randomness has included
  calling my mom, bursting out into glorious song, and taking hundreds of thousands
  of pictures of the inside of my pants. (Dark in there.)</li>\n<li> If the button-lock
  isn't on (it rarely is) my phone will switch from the useful 'Vibrate' mode to the
  useless 'Silent' mode in my pants. </li>\n<li> Occasionally- about one in 12 times,
  sliding the phone open or closed will cause the phone to crash.  The Motorola logo
  appears on screen for a couple of seconds, and when it comes back the phone will
  have no reception, and the background image will be replaced by a dull grey. Only
  a phone reboot will restore the background image. </li>\n<li> The most convenient
  way to answer the phone is by sliding it open, which, every now and then will cause
  the behavior I've described above- instead of answering the phone, I get an instant
  reboot.</li>\n<li> The software that arrived with the phone refused to install on
  Windows XP or Vista, claiming a missing .DLL file. </li>\n<li> Apparently, no replacement
  software or patches exist on the internet.  I could (potentially) order another
  copy for some unreasonable amount of money. </li> \n<li> My younger brother bought
  a similar phone- also Motorola- with the same software, but it refused to acknowledge
  the existance of my phone. </li>\n<li> The 'amazing' built in features are all broken
  and totally useless in one way or another: \n<ul>\n   <li>Mp3 Player: Stunted by
  lack of battery power. The mp3 jams totally drain the phone and are good for 2 hours,
  tops. Note that the phone (for some reason) comes with 2 entirely different mp3
  players, on the off chance that.. I don't like one of them?</li>\n   <li>Camera:
  \ <a href=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/images/stache.jpg\">Here</a> is a picture from
  the 2 megapixel camera.  No doubt, my younger brother is awesome, but the camera
  is <strong>terrible.</strong> </li>\n   <li>Video Player: See: mp3 player. On top
  of that, the lack of software makes uploading videos nary impossible. </li>\n   <li>Mobile
  Internet:  The built-in browser fails to render even the simplest of pages, and
  Bell's bandwidth charges are <strong>obscene</strong>  (In my case, $51.28/MB).
  \ They clearly want me to cave and add a $7 'mobile internet' plan to my phone if
  I want to use that feature- well, fuck them.</li>\n   <li>Text Messaging:  $0.15,
  outgoing <strong>or incoming</strong>, with a much higher rate if I happen to be
  texting outside of my default area.  They clearly want me to cave and add a $7 'text
  messaging' plan to my phone.  Well, fuck them. </li> \n   <li>Voice Dialing:  Does
  this work for <strong>anybody?</strong></li>\n   <li>Bluetooth Connectivity:  Unfortunately,
  I'm not a douchebag.  Who knew? </li> \n</ul>\n</li>\n\nAdditionally, it totally
  fails to make waffles.  I want a phone that can MAKE ME SOME DAMN WAFFLES. "
