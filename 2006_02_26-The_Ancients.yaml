  What''s the deal, Curtis, you might say if you were familiar with my body of works.
  (Which you''re not, of course).

  "Why are you posting comics that you finished at the very beginning of freshman
  year at SFU? You have newer, better comics to post! "


  Well, in my effort to place the entire bulk of my work online in no specific order,
  I''m jumping willy-nilly through my comic history. Why, you might even see some
  of the terrible webcomic that I produced in high-school. 


  I''ll make an effort to post something new and interesting every week, but the rest
  of the comics are going to be filler from times of yore, at least until times of
  yore dry up and I have to generate all the more interesting content.'
