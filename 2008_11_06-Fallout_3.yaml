  />\n\nOkay, I'll admit it- Fallout 3 has been eating an inordinate amount of my
  time.\n\nHonestly, with new games, I usually don't spend too much time with them.
  \ A few rounds here and there- the novelty pulls me in more than the actual gameplay.
  \n\nFallout 3, though, it's .. well, hours and hours of my life have disappeared
  inexplicably into the hole of Fallout 3.  \n\nThere are things in the game that
  are sorely lacking- the path of vice and evil just doesn't seem quite as evil as
  in the other Fallout games.  You can't kill children or pimp out your wife, and
  the game's main quest has a good/evil divergence.. but it's almost at the end, not
  at the beginning, so the bulk of the game's storyline only really goes one way.
  \ I suppose that games like Grand Theft Auto have raised the bar on our random violent
  urges, and games like KOTOR have raised the bar on our malicious, brooding, planned
  evil urges. \n\nGood or evil, your ability to sleep with random women is sorely
  limited- I mean, you'd think some of the girls in the wastes would want to get with
  the roaming savior of humanity, an intelligent, handsome 19-year old who is rough
  around the edges but ultimately good-hearted- one who, in many cases, has just saved
  their families/lives from roving bands of raiders/super mutants.  Maybe it's the
  mutton-chops?\n\nThe combat is.. well, it's just hard.  VATS is great, but once
  your action points expire, you either have to fruitlessly fire at your enemies or
  run screaming into the bushes to restore your action points.  A turn-based just-VATS
  system would be sweet, but the first-person shootery is just clunky and lame.  I
  worked around the problem by switching the combat to Very Easy- which dramatically
  lowers the hit points of all of your foes, in exchange for a much lower XP bonus
  for killing them.  I don't know- I find it fun to not be dying all the time. \n\nSo,
  why do I enjoy this?  If not for the combat and random viciousness, then what?  Well,
  I like me a good RPG.  Fallout 3 is a pretty good RPG.   I especially like having
  a shack in which to store all of my various scavenged swag, junk, and garden gnomes.
  I like building character stats, acquiring goods in unlikely locations, and saving
  people from stuff in an almost episodic way. \n\nNot to mention, my character looks
  like a total badass- although, for a brief while, the best equipment available for
  my character was Talon Combat Armor and a Motorcycle Helmet, which took my character
  from looking like a western badass to a .. Spaceball.  \n\n<img src=\"http://kapgar.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/spaceballs_combing.jpg\"
  alt=\"We ain't found shit.\" />\n\nYeah, all the ladies love a Spaceball with mutton
  chops.  I also like how my wearing the armor and insignia of the scariest, most
  villainous merceneries in the wasteland doesn't change anybody's perception of me
  at all. "
