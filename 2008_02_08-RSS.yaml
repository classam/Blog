content: ! "A lot of people read my site using a technology known as RSS - for you
  non-technical types, that's pronounced \"russ\" or if you're a really clear enunciator,
  'ruutaaabaaagaaa'. \n\nI was wondering if RSS just picks up the articles from my
  site once, or picks up the most-recent version of any articles that I write. I tend
  to do a lot of editing after I publish articles, to the point where anything that
  gets published on my site probably gets a complete working over about 5 minutes
  after it's published. \n\nJust wondering. TEAM LAZYWEB, GO!"
