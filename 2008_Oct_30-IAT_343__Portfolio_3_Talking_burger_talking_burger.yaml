  hours working on this stupid burger and fries, trying to coax some simple speech
  out of the burger.   What I have is.. okay- I'd like to spend more time on it, but
  everything's already late.  \n\n<img src=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/projects/iat343/portfolio2/burger.jpg\"
  alt=\"BURGER!\" />\n\nAll with a sort of deja-vu feel- I could swear I tried to
  do the same thing in high-school when I was fiddling around with 3D-Studio-Max 2
  or 3 (and inevitably got frustrated).  This burger is *much* better than the one
  I did when I was 14, but I'm still a long way from good or even competent. Also
  - and this is funny- 3D-Studio-Max was I think easier to learn than Maya.  None
  of the past 8 years have been spent on UI improvements, at least. \n\nWell, on to
  the meat and bones- a .wmv file, because the only movie-production software I had
  on my computer was (bluh) Windows Movie Maker. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/projects/iat343/portfolio2/gasp.wmv\">first</a>

  \"Talking Burger\" animations! (And the <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/projects/iat343/portfolio2/burger_drink_BT.mp\">.mp
  file for Maya PLE</a>) \n\nYou might need to turn up the sound to hear that.  Once
  again, the recording studio I used was... Microsoft Sound Recorder.  (TA DAAAA)"
