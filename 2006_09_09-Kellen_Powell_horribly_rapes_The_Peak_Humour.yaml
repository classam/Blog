  I just saw the first new Humour Page for The Peak.

  And then, afterwards, I wept.

  is back. And here I was hoping it was "burried" for good.

  <a href="http://www.peak.sfu.ca/the-peak/2006-3/issue1/wd0603_01.jpg">Warren''s
  Dream</a> is back. The horror. Oh, the horror.

  Kellen Powell''s ''hey, look, a picture with some <a href="http://www.peak.sfu.ca/the-peak/2006-1/issue7/u0601_07.jpg">words</a>
  on top of it'' comics are back.


  <a href="http://www.samandfuzzy.com/">Sam &amp; Fuzzy</a> is gone. *tears up*. My
  favourite comic in the whole world- and it''s not in The Peak anymore!


  I just didn''t write anything for the Peak. Too busy with my new job.

  You know what I miss? <a href="http://www.peak.sfu.ca/the-peak/2006-1/issue8/ae0601_08.jpg">Almost
  Evil</a>. That comic was *ghetto fabulous*, by all definitions of the word.'
