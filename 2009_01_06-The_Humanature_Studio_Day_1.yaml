content: ! "So, yesterday was my first day working at <a href=\"http://www.humanaturestudio.com/\">The
  Humanature Studio</a>.  It's an 8-month co-op, so I have.. let's see.. 8 months
  left to go.  I'll have a few pictures for you in the near future, after consulting
  the appropriate persons about what is and is not a 'photographable'. (Game companies
  take their confidentiality very seriously. )\n\nDay 1 had the mandatory \"Put Your
  Signature Here, Here and Here\".  After some questions about the contract, I had
  signed away all of my rights as a human being away for the contractually obligated
  amount of $1- which I have yet to receive. \n\nAfter that, my desk.  Oh yeah.  I'm
  right up against a window.  I've never had a software job with natural light before.
  It's beautiful.  Also? Two powerful computers, each with a 24\" screen, set up so
  that I can either have a dual screen or two computers.  \n\nThe cafeteria has an
  espresso machine, a standard coffee machine, and some sort of automated tea beast.
  \ I was shocked to discover that the automated tea beast had a mug-space smaller
  than my large mug.  Horrors!  This mug has been with me for years!\n\nThe office
  is generally very eco-friendly.  I know that every company in the past 10 years
  has had some sort of 'green team' environment-committee- but this one seems to actually
  have some sway.  All of my office supplies are from an <a href=\"http://www.frogfile.com/\">environmentally
  friendly office-supply company</a>.  My pens are wooden, and refillable.  We have
  *all* sorts of recycling bin, and - heck- our milk comes in a jar.  Really, this
  is a minimal-packaging office. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=840+Cambie+St,+Vancouver,+BC,+Canada&sll=49.121045,-122.72581&sspn=0.010729,0.027895&g=840+Cambie+St,+Vancouver,+BC,+Canada&ie=UTF8&z=16&iwloc=addr\">location</a>
  is fabulous- right in the middle of downtown Vancouver. \n\nEverybody in the office
  is cheery, friendly, and everybody goes home around 5:30.  Thanks to the fairly
  low turnover, everybody recognizes me as 'the new co-op'. \n\nAaand, I have my first
  assignment.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement\">NDA</a>
  aside, I can say one word and everybody will know what I'm talking about.  <a href=\"http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/\">Doxygen</a>.
  \n\nGuh. "
