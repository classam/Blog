  today's TOP TEN in the world of RSS. \n\n<h3> Number 10: Dan Challenges You To AvP
  </h3>\nDan Leslie would like to challenge you to a game of Alien Vs. Predator -
  and how can you turn him down when Steam is selling it <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/3730/\">for
  only $4.99? </a>\n\n<h3> Number 9: OCD </h3>\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/JaOdi.png\">A
  blow is struck</a> for those of us who don't like when our desks are out of order.
  \n\n<h3> Number 8 : Grammar Nazi </h3>\nDo you know that YouTube video <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8fbrUjjivw\">where
  Hitler freaks out because his entire cabinet are grammar Nazis</a>?  Or the YouTube
  clip where Hitler freaks out because he has been kicked from XBox Live? Or the YouTube
  clip where Hitler freaks out because...\n\nWell, apparently, the director of the
  original, \"Downfall\", <a href=\"http://www.slashfilm.com/2010/01/15/downfall-director-enjoys-the-pervasive-comedy-meme-featuring-his-film/\">loves
  that shit. </a> \n\n<h3> Number 7: You Smell So Nice</h3> \nRegardless of what happened
  to you today, <a href=\"http://ourstereo.com/compliment/\">Compliment Bot</a> thinks
  you're a cool person. \n\n<h3> Number 6: The FCC Won't Let Me Be (Or Let Me Be Free)
  </h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/14/AR2010011404717.html\">FCC
  looks at ways to assert authority over Web access</a>.  It sounds bad, but it's
  actually the Obama administration's attempt to use government muscle to enforce
  Net Neutrality, which is a <em>Good Thing</em>.  The broadband companies are pushing
  back, though, and hard. \n\n<h3> Number 5: Black Bedrooms </h3>\nThe ladies are
  all going crazy for <a href=\"http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/ny/bedroom/black-bedrooms-106146\">these
  sleek black bedroom designs. </a> Well, some of them. That fifth one is just <em>gaudy
  as all hell</em>, there's some zebra print in that collection, and a few of them
  look like domiciles of especially dark anime villains. Still, the first two are
  sleek and sexy in just the right way, dammit.\n\n<h3> Number 4: 10 Things You Can
  Do To Advance Your Career As A Developer </h3>\n<a href=\"http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/10things/?p=1297\">It's
  pretty self-explanatory</a>, and (while a tad pedestrian) it's all good, solid advice.
  \n\n<h3> Number 3: Dinosaur Sea Men </h3>\nDinosaur Comics is here to tell you about
  the <a href=\"http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1633\">LANGUAGE OF THE SEA.
  </a> \n\n<h3> Number 2: Five Reasons You Should Ditch Your DSLR </h3>\nOkay, camera
  nerds - DSLR has served you well for many a year, but the new technology on the
  spot provides the same quality, the ability to swap lenses, for a fraction of the
  size.  It also has <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/01/five-reasons-you-should-ditch-your-dslr/\">an
  unquestionably awesome acronym. </a> Will it pan out, or will it fall out of focus?\n\n<h3>
  Number 1: The Physics Of Space Battles </h3>\nStar Trek space battles seem to follow
  'navy rules' a lot of the time, while even more technically minded space battle
  simulators tend to ignore orbital dynamics in favor of 'open space' battles. <a
  href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5426453/the-physics-of-space-battles\">This article</a>,
  which thankfully sticks to layman's terms, explores some of the realities of imaginary
  space warfare.  While you're reading it, you can't help but imagine vast, operatic,
  gratuitous space battles, and that is awesome. "
