content: ! '<p>As most anybody who knows me can attest to, I''m only funny about 3%
  of the time. I, of course, believe that I am funny at least 18% of the time, but
  I am, of course, probably wrong about that.</p>

  <p>But I love to make comics!</p>

  <p>There''s clearly a problem here- How can somebody who cannot write funny comics
  regularly create a comic strip? (I know, Jim Davis doesn''t count.)</p>

  <p>That''s why I need a writer- Chris Demwell has volunteered, but he really hasn''t
  manufactured any of "The Funny", yet.  <a href="http://xore.ca/blog/">Rob</a> has
  also shown interest in writing comics.  I''m still declaring an open-season on comic
  creation, though- if you can come up with a good idea, I''ll make it into a comic
  for ya''.</p>

  <p>Of course, my artistic skills aren''t exactly top-notch, but they''ll do in a
  pinch.  I''m working on those- they''ll be professionally comic-worthy someday!
