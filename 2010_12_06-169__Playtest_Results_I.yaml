  It doesn't have any flavor, yet, it's very barebones - but I gathered Travis & Courteney
  for a playtest.\n\nFirst of all, we defined two rules that needed to be defined,
  that were not laid out in the original ruleset: \n\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>1.</strong>
  Creatures cannot intersect, except at the end of their turn. <em>This allows for
  creatures to act as 'blockers', and is how we played the game intuitively before
  Travis pointed out that there was not a rule for it and 'ghosted' through a blocker
  to take an objective. </em> </li>\n<li> <strong>2.</strong> Players must purchase
  a tile on their turn if they can. <em>This prevents players from stockpiling forever,
  waiting for the perfect piece for their strategy, and, ideally, speeds up the game.
  </em> </li> \n</ul>\n\nIn terms of emergent gameplay, the <strong>Wicked Witch Of
  The East</strong> rule - essentially, 'you may drop a building on a creature' -
  became a surprisingly driving factor of the game - not because it was necessarily
  strategic, but just because it's <em>fun</em> to drop a castle or a farm on top
  of a hero. \n\nOn the other hand, the <strong>Where We're Going, We Don't Need Roads</strong>
  rule, where creatures travel faster on road tiles, was all-but-ignored. Too complicated.
  Didn't come up, really. \n\nThe game was reasonably well balanced.  It also dragged
  on for a solid hour and a half, and felt repetitious and boring. \n\nMajor time-sinks
  included: \n\n<ul>\n<li> Planning multiple turns ahead was necessary, and the 'best
  path to take' was not always obvious.  This meant that a lot of time was spent staring
  at the board going 'hurmmm...' </li> \n<li> Many complex systems (co-ordinate, turn-rotation,
  money, creature movement) combine to make forming an intelligent strategy a long
  and involved process. </li>\n<li> Given multiple co-ordinate cards, the 'search
  space' of where one may place a token starts to get larger and larger. </li> \n<li>
  The entire first 45 minutes of the game, where territory was established and lightly
  fought over. </li>\n</ul> \n\nSome theories as to improve playability include: \n\n<ul>\n
  <li> The removal of the concept of 'money' from the game - no purchase price for
  tiles, and no money-generating tiles. (This means that players can play castles
  from the get-go, but they will also need to defend them from the get-go.) This:\n<ul>\n<li>
  Removes a single source of complexity from the game, simplifying planning. </li>\n<li>
  Removes two tile-types from the game, simplifying tile-choice. </li> \n<li> Speeds
  up the acquisition of castles (victory units), aggressively moving the end-game
  forward. </li>\n<li> Puts the focus more aggressively on the 'creature' game mechanic.
  </li> \n</ul>\n</li>\n\n <li> A smaller game world. 13x13 (169 tiles) is a lot of
  space for three people to cover. Less world means more conflict. </li>\n\n<li> A
  turn-clock. (The oldest and laziest technique for getting people to move-the-fuck
  forward.) </li>  \n</ul>\n\nIt's still not fun, but with work, perhaps it can get
  there."
