  be doing.. when I happen across <a href=\"http://positivesharing.com/2007/10/the-top-5-problems-with-corporate-team-building/\">this</a>
  article about corporate team building.  Now, I don't know why, but I always enjoy
  this kind of thing- and before I knew it, I'd read about 4 articles on the site
  and had bookmarked the whole thing.\n\nAside from the well-written articles straight
  out of the pages of Peopleware, what was the trick that got me clicking? At the
  bottom of every post is a set of 'related articles' from the site- 3 articles that
  might also catch my eye if I liked the article that I just read. \n\nI thought about
  it- wait a minute- every time I've been on a site where I've enjoyed an article
  and found the \"Related Posts\" or \"Related Articles\" under it.. I've usually
  clicked on one of those articles.  Heck, <a href=\"http://www.mcsweeneys.net/\">McSweeney's
  </a> is a site whose entire navigational system seems to be based on the \"Related
  Articles\".. and McSweeney's has used that selfsame tactic to trap me on their site
  for hours- days, even.\n\nIn order for this to work, posts need eye-catching, descriptive
  titles, and you have to do the research to put those three posts together.. or maybe
  write a quick blog plug-in to handle it for you - but it seems like a good strategy.
  \ (Categories might be the way to go- categorize all of the content, hide the Categories
  bar, and then fetch the last 3 from the same category to go under each post.)"
