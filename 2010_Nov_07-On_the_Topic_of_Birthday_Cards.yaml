  articles expound endlessly on a variety of topics completely and utterly ridiculous.</em>\n\nGood
  afternoon, the internet. I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of office politicking,
  have just experienced the magic of trying to buy birthday cards for co-workers.
  \n\nBuying a birthday card is already a process fraught with peril.  You can and
  will spend at least 20 minutes carefully selecting a card. \"The risqué one?\",
  you ask yourself. \"No, grandma wouldn't like that.\"  \n\nAfter minutes and minutes
  of deliberation, you finally find some combination of humour and well-wishing that
  reasonably establishes your relationship with the person that you are buying the
  card for. When the big day finally arrives, said person is now forced to deal with
  a whole pile of birthday cards, each one representing about 20 minutes of careful
  selection time, and about $4 of financial outlay.  \n\nThese cards are completely
  worthless.  \n\nThe real gold is what might be contained within; a heartwarming
  message from your family (\"We love you!\") - a funny message from your family (\"We
  love you, now pick up your damn socks!\") -  money (\"We $ you!\") - or laundered
  credit cards (\"We IDENTITY THEFT you!\").  My enjoyment of these things are <em>in
  no way</em> affected by a two-dollar picture of a dog on a surf-board.  This makes
  me think that the expensive birthday card could easily be replaced with a 30 cent
  envelope, and the world would not be affected negatively in any way. \n\nThe trouble
  becomes even more pronounced when buying birthday cards from the office, to co-workers.
  \ First of all, the relationship expressed by the card is ... well, an aggregate.
  \"All of these people probably want you to experience some sort of cheer on this,
  the anniversary of your birth.\"  \n\nOn top of that, birthday cards come from a
  limited set of 'birthday card groups', and none of them are really appropriate for
  a co-worker. Let's take a look at some of the common ones: \n\n<h3> The \"You're
  Not Very Sharp, Are You?\" Cards. </h3>\nCertain birthday cards are designed for
  people who have difficulty comprehending even the most basic things about themselves
  and their environment.  They usually have things like \"IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY!\" and
  \"YOU'RE TURNING 14!\" on the front, informing the recipient in <em>exuberant boldface</em>
  things that they already know. \n\nWhile it seems a little bit redundant, I imagine
  that it would be fun to apply this same ebullient principle to your everyday life.
  \ Find a laser printer and some card stock, and print off a whole batch of these
  things to hand out to your co-workers for day-to-day occurrences. \n\n<ul>\n<li>
  YOU ARE WEARING PANTS! </li>\n<li> TODAY IS MONDAY! </li>\n<li> YOU ARE TALLER THAN
  YOU ARE WIDE! </li> \n<li> LUNCHTIME IS NIGH! </lI>\n<li> YOU'RE POOPING! <small>(this
  one works best if passed under a toilet stall door)</small></li>\n</ul> \n\n<h3>
  The \"You're Getting Old, Ha Ha\" Cards. </h3>\nThere's no shortage of cards that
  deliver a one-two punch of 'Happy Birthday' and 'Hey, You're Getting Pretty Old'.
  \ They make jokes about incontinence, death, and general sagginess - all common
  side-effects of old age <small>(or being put inside a microwave).</small>\n\n<h3>
  The \"Sexy Sexy Fake-Out\" </h3>\nHey, buddy! How would you like to look at a <a
  href=\"http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20060628193016/uncyclopedia/images/c/c0/Tit.jpg\">pair
  of tits</a>?  Oh ho ho! <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRZXEoLgD1I\">I
  got you good, you fucker</a>!  Wait, how about maybe you want to check out some
  <a href=\"http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090121211931/uncyclopedia/images/1/15/ChicksWithGuns.jpg\">hot
  chicks</a>?  Or maybe a ...\n\nOkay, I'll stop.  You know the routine, though.  The
  promise of <a href=\"http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1827\">sexy times</a>,
  followed by the all-too-predictable play on words or last-minute switch-up.  I think
  a card that actually contained attractive women/men/whatever as promised would be
  funny as a kind of birthday card anti-joke - well, at least until the Department
  of Stale Birthday Card Humour found out about that. \n\n<h3> Cards That Do Stuff
  </h3>\nOkay, you can always tell when you've picked up one of these cards because
  they are heavy. Sometimes they have pull-tabs.  Sometimes they are a little thicker
  in the middle than the outside. \n\nThe trick is that, when you open such a card,
  \"The Macarena\" will play, poodles will dance, paper streamers will shoot out,
  and thousands of tiny fireworks will go off.  Okay! A gimmick! That won't get old
  incredibly fast!\n\n<h3> Rhyming</h3>\n<blockquote>\nThe brightest sun\nCould never
  do\nA thing for someone\nJust like you \n</blockquote>\n\no_o\n\n-_-\n\no_o\n\n<h3>
  Sentimentality </h3>\nThis card will try to express some sort of deep emotion -
  or at least, you know, class up the rhyming scheme with maybe some AABAAB.  Ultimately,
  though, the words in the card mean slightly less to people who realize exactly how
  many of that special unique card exist. (According to a number that I just made
  up, 93 katrillion.) \n\nThese cards are among the most inappropriate for a co-worker,
  unless you want to wander into creepy stalker-town.\n\n<h3> You Are Person X! </h3>\nThere
  are, of course, reams of cards for every human relationship. \n\"Happy Birthday,
  Brother/Sister/Mother/Father/Son/Daughter/Uncle/Nephew/Aunt/Niece/Grandmother/Family
  Friend Who Has a Moustache and Makes You Uncomfortable/Kenneth/Grandfather/Great
  Aunt!\" \n\n<h3> All-Of-The-Above </h3>\nDon't think that you're not already trying
  to combine all of the above in your head.  You're not? Now I'm sad. \n\nSo... that
  about wraps up this drunken mid-morning brain dump."
