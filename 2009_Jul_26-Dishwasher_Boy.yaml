content: ! "When I was sixteen, my uncle gave me a job in his kitchen.  I was to wash
  dishes. \n\nI wasn’t much of a punk – my blue hair was more an attempt to be unique
  than to rebel against anything in specific, but nevertheless, I had to wear a hat,
  all summer long, in the sweltering heat, in a cramped kitchen.  It was a nice restaurant,
  and certain standards had to be kept up. My station was right next to the stove.
  \ I washed dishes. \n\nThe golf course where I worked had a few customers, occasionally.
  \ During the day, it was never more than a few plates or mugs.  The dishes were
  so minor as to be inconsequential. A couple of plates, or a strainer, maybe a glass
  or two.  I tried to help out in the kitchen whenever I could, but the cooking staff
  never wanted to trust much to the dish boy, and, in all fairness, I wasn’t too handy
  with a pan anyways.  I could grill a burger six ways from Sunday, and I even made
  my way through about 30% of the lunch menu, but toss a more difficult pasta dish
  at me and I was lost.  In the end, the only person I ever cooked for was me, on
  my lunch break.  The hierarchy was clear, with my uncle at the very top, the cooks
  beneath him, then the prep cooks, and then, at the very bottom, me.\n\nIn order
  to try to clear my name of the stink of nepotism, I helped wherever and however
  I could.  It was my first job, though, and I was just getting the hang of not being
  a lazy lump of teenage uselessness.  I like to think that I helped more than I hurt,
  anyways.  For one thing, I pioneered a nacho-cooking technique that managed to save
  anybody washing nacho pans (see: me) minutes a day of furious cheese-scraping. Protip:
  toss a tortilla shell under those bad-boys. It looks good on the plate and you can
  just toss it out when people are done eating. \n\nBut why would they hire a dishwasher
  when they don’t need one during the day? \n\nIt’s simple. They needed a dishwasher
  at night.  The course had beautiful grounds, and on the weekends, they would have
  huge, catered weddings.  The kitchen would be blazing with prep cooks and real cooks,
  hurrying around and preparing food in hundredweight buffet pans.  Cooking for two
  hundred people at one event is more fraying than one would imagine, even if it’s
  in the same kitchen and the same grounds every Sunday.  The dishes would fly my
  way, faster than I could handle them.  \n\nThe dishwasher itself was a huge, lumbering
  beast, the likes of which I had never seen.  At home, I had a little Maytag dishwasher
  that hummed and phutted and took 50 minutes to get through a load.  In the kitchen,
  we had a rattling goliath that belched steam and cleared a plastic pallet of dishes
  in three minutes. \n\nEven with the gargantuan dishwasher, though, dishes came faster
  than they could be run through the machine.  The dishwasher also had to be run from
  both sides – dishes in, dishes out, put them away when they’re done. <em>Quickly,
  the wait staff needs more knives!</em>\n\nOver the course of the job, I received
  more cuts and burns than in my entire adult life to date.  At the time, I was shocked
  that they expected me to continue working, even though I had just touched my knuckles
  to the sides of a hot oven.  \n\nIt paid $6.50 an hour.\n\nThose brief glimpses
  of my uncle at work were totally different from what I had experienced from him
  at home.  The big, jovial uncle of mine was dead serious. The messy uncle who slept
  20 hours at a stretch was instead a whirlwind of serious activity, criticizing anything
  so much as a smudge in his pristine kitchen.\n\nThat’s my experience with the food
  industry.  My whole family’s been in and out of it, all of them, much longer than
  I ever have.  It’s a different sort of world.  Interesting, though. \n"
