  articles cover a topic near and dear to my heart: Making things look pretty. </em>\n\nSo,
  I've been experimenting with sIFR, as a way to use Univers fonts on my website without
  having to generate images for <em>each individual blog-post title on my site</em>.
  \n\nNow, I love the idea of sprucing up dynamic content with real typography &mdash;
  but I don't think that sIFR is the answer, at least not yet.\n\n<h3> Slow to Load.
  </h3>\nYes, okay, we're on the internet of the future, we have infinite bandwidth
  and all computers are speed demons, sure.  The thing is, though, nothing loads faster
  as blog title headers than <em>plain text</em>.  sIFR even seems to underperform
  properly-tweaked images. \n\nSo sIFR is slow.  It feels slow. \n\n<h3> Bug Me Not
  </h3>\nI'm not sure if you've noticed, but sIFR seems to be cutting off chunks of
  headline at random on my site.  Not cool! That's a gamebreaking bug for me. \n\nMy
  first course of action here will be to replace it with sIFR 3, the fresh version.
  \ Should that fail, I'm back to good ol' fashioned text. \n\n<h3> Search Me Not
  </h3>\nCan't search through headers.  If, you know, you wanted to. \n\n<h3> Ultimately,
  the Wrong Solution </h3>\nWhen it comes down to it, dynamically rendering fonts
  using Flash intuitively feels like it's the wrong solution for web typography.  \n\nFor
  one thing, most web browsers already render fonts, fine. Why go to all of the extra
  effort to render additional fonts outside of the browser?\n\nIn an ideal world,
  one would just be able to embed a font straight-up in the page, file and all.  Most
  font foudries would, however, get their panties all atwist at the thought of people
  getting one of their expensive, expensive fonts just... sent to them. Over the internet.
  \ And now they can use that font for whatever they want, forever. \n\nSo, once again,
  the mighty beast of copyright stands between us and the most elegant technical solution.
  \n\nI suppose one could champion a movement for distribution of Creative-Commons
  or similarly open-licensed fonts.  Perhaps someone could push some of the major
  browsers to include some fonts from the <a href=\"http://openfontlibrary.org/\">Open
  Font Library </a> - or at least, allow people to embed fonts in webpages if they
  are using open license fonts.  (This of course creates the problem of people hacking
  closed-source fonts to make them appear to be open-sourced fonts. See? This is a
  tough problem. )\n\nThe Open Font Library itself could use a new influx of life,
  through more participation from developers and designers.  Developers could introduce
  some features to make it more relevant and useful, like the ability to preview fonts,
  sort them by popularity, that sort of good thing. Designers &mdash; well &mdash;
  Open Typography needs a hero, an Adrian Frutiger, a William Caslon, a John Baskerville,
  a ... Carol Twombly.\n\nImagine if each Firefox update came with 3 new fonts that
  Web Developers could count on. Would it be a bad idea? It would make pages less
  standard, and developers would have to use the font-family tag properly &mdash;
  first using a OpenFont font, then a Mac Standard, then a Windows Standard, and finally
  the Default Family. \n\nTypography on the web needs a hero. Or a couple of heroes.
  Or many heroes.  It's important. \n\n<h3> What Choice Do We Have? </h3>\n\nOf course,
  until the state of open typography on the web improves, our only option for dynamic
  fonts are to hack them into either Flash or images - and I think that 'images' might
  be the more efficient of the two, even if it's the less accessible.\n\nThe best
  solution, at least in terms of speed, ease, accessibility, and simplicity, seems
  just be to stick with the small subset of available fonts that come with the system.
  \ But we can do better, right? "
