  I can't say I'm all-too disappointed- I was beginning to have second thoughts about
  the whole process anyways- I was kind of wishing I had just done a normal Co-Op.\n\nThe
  rejection was (of course) because of my grades.  When it comes down to it, I shoot
  for C-'s in Math courses and really dry, theoretical CS courses- and waste my time
  learning <a title=\"PHP\" href=\"http://www.php.net/\">More</a> <a title=\"Django\"
  href=\"http://www.djangobook.com/\">Interesting</a> <a title=\"Subversion\" href=\"http://subversion.tigris.org/\">Things</a>.
  \ Personally, I think that makes be a better developer- although it means I'm probably
  not going to find my way into graphics or statistical analysis any time soon.  I'll
  leave that to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_retentive\">people
  who enjoy math</a>. \n\nMuch like most of those upper-level students at SFU, I'm
  becoming more and more disillusioned with the university experience- I really am
  starting to just want to get out ASAP.  I've still got 10 courses to go- 3 of which
  can be from any faculty, any level, really anything. (Honestly, can't I just give
  the university $1000, get three A's, and we'll call it a deal?). \n\nPast that,
  it's one, last math course to desperately try to get a C- in, despite my poor understanding
  of every prerequisite math course since about Grade 10.  That leaves 6 CS courses,
  of which 1 must be Greg's <acronym title=\"310\">Artificial Intelligence</acronym>,
  1 must be the other Greg's <acronym title=\"470\">Web-Based Information Systems</acronym>,
  1 must be <acronym title=\"401\">Operating Systems II</acronym>, and.. well, 1 more
  300-level and 2 more 400-level, perhaps drawn at random by throwing darts at a blind
  man. (I can't think of anything else I really want to take. <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/114/\">Computational
  Linguistics</a> looked fun, maybe?) \n\nSo, now, it's time to apply for a couple
  of jobs!  I'm going to hit up IBM, Blue Castle, maybe take a look at a few other
  companies. "
