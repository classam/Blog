content: ! "Okay, so, I'm fiddling with the Half-Life 2 SDK.  I'm curious, darn-it,
  and I want to see how easy it is to make mods with it. I'm a nerdy guy, right? \n\nMy
  first step was to install Visual Studio 2005, MSDN, and the free <a href=\"http://www.softimage.com/products/modtool/default.aspx\">Softimage
  Mod Tools</a>.\n\nNow, there's a <a href=\"http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/My_First_Mod\">tutorial</a>
  available at Valve's Developer Center.  One thing that I've found so far about the
  Developer Center is that it's a wiki, not a reference document.  And because it's
  a wiki, a lot of the articles are confusingly written, and there's a lot of missing
  information. \n\nImmediately, I encountered my first problem.  When I tried to use
  the SDK to create a mod, stocked with all of the delicious code required to get
  started, I had to deal with a confusing error. \"The source code distributed with
  this version of the Source SDK is not compatible with the \"Orange Box\" version
  of the Source engine.\"  \n\nSo, now what? \n\n<strong>Solution: </strong>Right-click
  on Source SDK in Steam, go to Properties, then click on 'Set launch options', and
  in the box that pops up, type in \"-engine ep1\" (without quotes) and then launch
  the SDK.\n\nOkay, so I'm running an older version of the Source engine, but I've
  started. Huzzah! Let's continue.  I just have to load the project file in \nVisual
  Studio, and I'm ready.\n\nOkay, now for the second problem. The tutorial mentions
  a file to edit- <code>hl2_dll/weapon_rpg.cpp</code>. This file is nowhere to be
  found. \n\n<strong>Solution:</strong> Ignore it for now, I'll hunt for it later.\n\nOkay,
  let's compile!  (compile compile compile).. \n\nAnd 20 minutes later, we're ready
  to rock! We've now started Half-Life 2: The Modded Version.  It's just like Half-Life
  2: The Unmodded Version, except that it doesn't have any maps and I can't start
  a New Game.  This is good, though, at least it works!\n\nOkay, so.. how do I put
  some maps in the mod? I want to try walking about a bit, at least. \n\n<strong>Solution:
  </strong>  Download and install <a href=\"http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=26\">GCFScape</a>,
  then go into the <code>Program Files/Steam/steamapps</code> directory and find <code>half-life
  2 content.gcf</code>. Open wide, and it's maps directory is full of maps that can
  then be copied directly into the Maps folder of the mod that we've just cracked
  open. \n\nUnfortunately, this method, at least according to the tutorial, is illegal
  if I want to distribute the mod.  There aren't any articles on why (perhaps someone
  could suck enough information out of the assorted mods to reconstruct HL2 for free?),
  nor are there any articles on how to legally nab HL2 maps. Maybe it's just not allowed
  at all? I don't know. \n\nSo, finally, in order to wander in to the map, I need
  to open the developer console.  Tilde. Tilde. TILDE, dammit! Why won't you come
  up?\n\n<strong>Solution</strong>: In \"Options\", \"Keyboard\", \"Advanced\", there's
  a checkbox to enable the developer console. Aha!\n\nAfter dealing with that one,
  last problem, I'm on my way, running a HL2 mod that has no new content in it whatsoever.
  It's a start!  I've also come to the conclusion that the Mod documentation needs
  some serious work.  I'm going to keep a record of my discoveries, and try to keep
  the Wiki up-to-date so that other people don't have to slog through the same problems
  that I did. \n"
