content: ! "Okay, so I've basically compiled <a title=\"The List\" href=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/projects/CMPT0108.html\">a
  huge list of the 300-level CMPT courses this semester</a>, their professors, their
  times, my thoughts re: their professors and times, and a ranking of their desirability.
  \ Certain 'extra weights' have been added to required courses.\n\nThey came in in
  this order:\n\n300  +8\n384  +5\n307  +4\n365  +4\n320  +4\n371  +3\n361  +2\n310
  \ +1\n383  +1\n308  -2\n368  -2\n354  -3\n305  -8\n363  -8\n370  -11\n\nSo now,
  I can take all of this data, strip out the courses I don't want to take, alter the
  weights a little bit (365 is comin' in a bit high, I think), add the additional
  courses that I also need or want to take (STAT 270, MACM 316) and build a Python
  program to try to produce the best possible timetable given that data.\n\nOf course,
  you can contribute to the project by adding your own opinions of professors and
  courses. \n\nEdit: Thanks to Greg's comments, the scores have been mildly revised. "
