  Firebug equivalent for Webkit/Safari, you can enter the following snippet into your
  Mac's Terminal: \n\n<code>defaults write com.apple.Safari WebKitDeveloperExtras
  -bool true</code>\n\nThis will give you the ability to \"Inspect Element\", which
  is very, very useful.  It brings up the Mac Web Developer Console, a sort of useful
  multi-tool for the web.  In fact, after the appearance of the ubiquitous and incredibly
  useful FireBug, it would seem that most of the major browsers are going the way
  of integrated web-development tool modules. Nice!\n\n<h3>FireBug</h3> \n\nI'm not
  going to lie &mdash; FireBug completely changed the way that I write markup.  Instead
  of laboriously fiddling with a CSS value and refreshing repeatedly (How does 74px
  look? How does 80px look? ), I just toss in a nonsense value, then inspect the element
  I'm working with in FireBug.  From there, I can select any of the values that I
  want to play with, and hold the up/down keys to watch that value change in real-time.
  \ You can also add new CSS properties on the fly to see how they change the page.
  Useful!  \n\nThe Safari Web Developer Console allows you to inspect elements and
  change CSS, but you can't <em>slide</em> elements.  Which is okay, I guess.  I mean,
  every product works a little bit differently. \n\n<h3>Size</h3>\n\nThe Safari Console
  *also* allows you to determine the full download size of a page of your website.
  \ Notably, this website's index page, pictures and all, occupies less than 100kb
  of space &mdash; but Javascript plugins (jQuery, jQuery UI, and the plugin for code
  rendering) and sIFR eat up another 400kb of space, making the whole site a bit of
  a pig.  Alternatively, I've written full-on Wordpress sites that <a href=\"http://www.chownow.ca/blog/\">pack
  tidily into less than 70kb</a>.  Google's front-page clocks in at a svelte 36kb,
  and Yahoo's front-page a beefy 1Mb. \n\nNotably, this functionality exists in FireBug,
  but it's not nearly as pretty or intuitive, so I never really played around with
  it. \n\nIn fact, the Safari Console has a few features that could be really helpful
  for someone pulling a page to bits.  It lists all of the images used on the page,
  where they come from, and their size and dimensions. It also lists all of the stylesheets
  and javascript elements loaded on a page.  Actually, looking at my site, one of
  the reasons that it's so big is that the JavaScript Code Highlighter that I'm using
  depends on a number of 'brush' files (one for each language family being highlighted),
  each with a very large, identical copyright notice.  I bet trimming <em>that</em>
  down could cut a couple kilobytes from this site's hefty frame. \n\n<h3>JavaScript</h3>\n\nWhen
  I started programming in Javascript, I found also that FireBug logs Javascript errors
  in a tidy format that makes it painfully clear what's gone wrong with the page.
  As well, you can toss a console.log( \"foo\" ) statement in your page, to print
  output directly to the FireBug console.  For debugging, this is like <em>sex cheese</em>.
  \n\nNotably, this also fills me with frustration whenever a jQuery library module
  starts throwing an obscure error.  Am I doing something wrong? \n\nThe Safari Console
  seems also to have a console for logging. I haven't really fiddled with it. For
  that sort of work, I'm almost guaranteed to go to FireBug unless it's a Safari-specific
  error. \n\n<h3> Okay, Windows, You're Up To Bat </h3>\n\nSo, Safari and Firefox
  both have robust developer console systems, albeit each one with strengths and weaknesses.
  \ What does Internet Explorer have? \n\n<em>crickets</em>\n\n<em>tumbleweed</em>\n\nActually,
  you'd be surprised. Internet Explorer is home to a small set of <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/06/22/from-microsoft-teched-2007-web-development-tools-for-internet-explorer.aspx\">development
  tools</a> as well, for those developers in the unfortunate circumstance of having
  to develop for it as a primary.  I haven't tried any of them, and they seem to be
  quite the mishmash of miscellany, but it's good to know that the tools exist. \n\n<h3>
  And The Rest </h3>\nGoogle Chrome has a very rudimentary set of built-in developer
  tools, although it's so small as to be nearly meaningless &mdash you can't even
  change CSS on the fly.  \n\nThat just leaves Opera, and, while it was an empty field
  for a while, they're currently working on <a href=\"http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/\">Dragonfly</a>,
  a yet-another-developer-console, for Opera.  Considering, however, Opera's much-greater-pull
  in the mobile world, they're integrating a host of tools that work with assorted
  mobiles.  It's still in 'alpha', though, so the software might not be as rock solid
  as one might hope. \n\n"
