  paper: <a href=\"http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html\">Are You Living
  In A Computer Simulation?</a>.\n\nYou can read it, if you like.  It's a bit wordy,
  but the gist of the argument is this: start with the postulate that posthuman civilizations
  will have computing power enormous enough to run 'people simulators'.  The argument
  is then, either, \n<ol>\n<li> Humans will never reach the 'posthuman' stage. </li>\n<li>
  Posthuman civilizations will never run 'people simulators', or</li>\n<li> It is
  almost certain that you are currently running in a computer simulation. </li>\n</ol>\n\nThe
  author argues that - being as we're unsure as to which one is actually true- we
  should assign each possibility an equal chance.  \n\nNow, here are my objections
  to the theory. \n\n<strong>1.  Universes can't be simulated very easily. </strong>
  While running a 'people simulator' shouldn't be altogether too difficult- I mean,
  there's only so much 'people' to go around- our environment is a much more tricky
  matter.  It would be impossible to run a simulation of the universe down to the
  quantum level- for one thing, storing a universe full of data would require at least
  an equivalent universe full of data storage.  (If you think about it, even if we
  used the quantum spin of every electron in the universe to store data, we would
  only have enough data storage to hold the quantum spin of every electron in a universe.
  ) \n\n<strong>2. Computers are Hard </strong> When it comes down to it, some computer
  problems just can't be solved in a reasonable amount of time.  It's easy to work
  on computers and run into a problem that will take too long to solve, regardless
  of processor power.  Very large data sets with exponential or factorial solution
  times become literally impossible to solve for - and n-body simulation of an entire
  universe would certainly fall under this purview.   Even with nigh-infinite computing
  power at our fingertips, nigh-more-infinite computing speed would be required to
  solve some of these problems.  The estimate of 10^36-10^37 operations per second
  to simulate all of human history seems a bit naively low- keeping track of mere
  gravity for a single galaxy worth of atoms (10^69 atoms- large data set, and then
  an exponential growth rate to the algorithm's run time) would require a lot more
  computing speed than that. \n\n<strong>3. Universe-Spanning Supercomputers are Bound
  To Be Expensive</strong> - Even expecting that we'll find ways to build planet-sized
  supercomputers that can perform untold numbers of operations per second and store
  unimaginable amounts of data - assuming there are no as-yet-undiscovered physical
  laws of the Universe putting hard universal caps on this sort of thing- putting
  an entire planet or galaxy to work simulating a little mini-Earth would probably
  be an expensive task.  We have a limited number of galaxies to work with, you know.
  \n\n<strong>4. Lossy </strong> So, from 1 and 2, one can then conclude that a Universe
  simulation would have to be extremely lossy - and by 'lossy' I mean \"If you're
  not looking at Pluto, it's not there.\" The only trouble is, that means that in
  order to keep us from discovering that we live in a lossy universe- by simulating
  universal properties for us to discover- our simulation needs to be both omniscient
  and super-intelligent.  While computing power may be tremendous in the future, omniscient
  super-intelligent universe management sounds like a difficult software package to
  put together, no matter how super-powered the hardware may be.  The Universe would
  need to be Intelligently Designed- not simulated- and most people with a solid grounding
  in the sciences have trouble accepting Intelligent Design for a <em>number</em>
  of reasons. \n\n<strong>5. Infinitely Nested Lossy Universes. </strong> Simply enough-
  if our Universe is heavily lossy, to save computational time and storage space,
  we would lack the computational time and storage space to run our own Universe.
  \ The sub-universe that we run would have to be aggressively simpler.  We then get
  a sort of Matryoshka doll effect- with each Universe being significantly less complex
  than the last.  I can't see this being possible for any more than one or two iterations
  at best.  (In the same way, running a VM in a VM in a VM will suck up all of the
  system resources of most of the VM's, and going more than a few iterations down
  becomes extremely inefficient- and sort of pointless. ) \n\nSo, we now have the
  three original postulates, revamped to address some of my concerns.  Either...\n<ol>
  \n<li>Humans will never reach the stage where they have enough computing power to
  simulate entire universes, be it by extinction or sheer lack of Universal computing
  clout. </li>\n<li> Humans will not be willing to spend the incredible amount of
  time and resources required to Intelligently Design and Manage every element of
  a complex universe. </li> \n<li> You are almost certainly living in a computer simulation.
  </li>\n</ol>\n\nNow, given that these are all unknowns, we could assign them an
  equal chance of being correct- but that's not how unknowns work.  Instead, we will
  assign much heavier likelihood to the first two, with a very mild chance that the
  third- a wacky out-of-third-base theory- might potentially be correct.  In the same
  way, however, there's a mild chance that the Christian God (or a Greek Pantheon)
  might be intelligently designing and managing the universe in the same way.  I lend
  little credence to any of these theories. \n\nThus: Are you living in a computer
  simulation?  Probably not.  "
