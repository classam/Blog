content: ! 'Warren Haas, humour editor for "The Peak", much-vaunted news-rag of SFU
  that it is, has managed to insult <a href="http://www.peak.sfu.ca/the-peak/2006-1/issue7/op-ed.html">just
  about everybody</a> at SFU.  Yang''s response was swift, and brutal, telling Warren
  Haas that he is <a href="http://www.peak.sfu.ca/the-peak/2006-1/issue8/le-haas2.html">so
  very, very wrong.</a> Chris Conway also takes a much less erudite shot at Warren
  for <a href="http://www.peak.sfu.ca/the-peak/2006-1/issue8/le-haas1.html">the same
  thing</a>.


  In Warren''s defense, some lower-level art courses are really goddamn easy, and
  taking less than 5 due to the ''workload'' would be silly and lazy. Most of the
  courses at SFU, however, involve so much struggling against professors who couldn''t
  explain the concept of ''hard'' to a rock, that taking more than a few at a time
  would guarantee instant insanity.

  Following the same damn Mohammed-comic controversy as the rest of the world, some
  doof invoked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin''s_law">Godwin''s Law</a>
  in a <a href="http://www.peak.sfu.ca/the-peak/2006-1/issue7/le-toons.html">letter
  </a>to "The Peak". By invoking the Nazi analogy, he automatically loses the discussion,
  even if he''s not technically on USENET. The responses to his letter are almost
  worse than the letter itself, and they''ve also used the tried-and-true Hitler reference
  to ''drive their point home''.


  The only really enlightened response was the carefully crafted <a href="http://www.peak.sfu.ca/the-peak/2006-1/issue7/le-toons2.html">letter
  from the Muslim Student Association</a>. The gist? "This is insulting. We disapprove.
  We believe in free speech, but don''t use it to deride people." In this case, I
  completely agree. The comics were tasteless and racist, and clearly shouldn''t have
  been printed in the first place. To print them in ''solidarity'' is every bit as
  tasteless. The solution to look upon the comics with stern disapproval and write
  well-crafted letters-to-the-editor, however, is probably the most mature way to
  look at the situation.'
