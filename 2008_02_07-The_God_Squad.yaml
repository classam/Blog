content: ! "For me, becoming an atheist was a deeply personal experience- Through
  soul-searching, study, and meditation I managed to discover the true meaning of
  the universe. A duck.  Having concluded that the universe is a rather silly and
  unknowable entity, I took the pragmatic position of militant agnostic- I don't know
  and neither do you!  Eventually, a series of articles and books convinced me that
  this sort of <acronym title=\"Prove it.\">general disbelief</acronym> really falls
  more under the aegis of atheism, so there I went.\n\nThis is all a bit of a prelude
  to the following story, where by some hookery and crookery, Kristen managed to drag
  me to a <acronym title=\"IT BURNS!\">bible study</acronym>.  It wasn't entirely
  a swindle on her part- she told me that it was a young-adult group organized by
  her church, and that there was likely to be religious people. I was a bit wary,
  but fun activities were promised, and Kristen wanted to go, so I tentatively <acronym
  title=\"Love stinks.\">agreed to go with her</acronym>. \n\nThis meeting of the
  young-adult group - and Kristen assured me that this is fairly rare- happened a
  bible study, a long and painful experience of forced-churching.  We got to talk
  about God's Grace, and doesn't that just sound fabulous. \n\nIn case you're <acronym
  title=\"I certainly wasn't\">wondering</acronym>, in a biblical sense, Mercy is
  when you deserve something bad but don't get it, and Grace is when you don't deserve
  anything but you get something good anyways.  Ah, that old biblical standby- you
  suck, you're horrible, but even though you don't deserve anything, ever, God will
  be your cosmic hook-up. \n\nWhile I find Christians perfectly tolerable while they're,
  say, <acronym title=\"See: Dominic Lau\">getting owned at a game of Civilization</acronym>,
  when they're going on and on about how god had/has a plan for their life, I start
  to wish I was at the dentist, having hot needles poked into my gums.  This is why
  I don't go to churches- I end up sitting quietly, nervously hoping that nobody calls
  on me - because when pressed for information, at some point I'm going to have to
  reveal that I've slotted 'God' in the same mental cubby as The Easter Bunny, Santa
  Claus, and Good Tech Support.\n\nAt some point, someone said, \"My Grampa said,
  kill 'em with kindness' \". I came up with the ever-so-horrible response, \"My Grampa
  said, 'kill 'em with pillows while they're sleeping', but they took him away a long
  time ago. \"  Somehow, I managed not to say it, although I can imagine I turned
  beet red for a couple of minutes and probably fidgeted uncomfortably. \n\nAt the
  end of the night, plans were made for a big post-romance Valentine's Day party,
  what with chocolate and boyfriends and romantic movies.  I suggested that we watch
  my favourite romantic movie, \"Evil Dead 2\", and the one other guy there who wasn't
  a Christian has a bit of a chuckle. (He then tried to explain it to his girlfriend-
  it doesn't sound like it went well.) \n\nSo, I ended up making an agreement with
  Kristen.  <acronym title=\"Fucking inconvenient love.\">I'll go back</acronym>,
  but I reserve the right to say whatever might be on my mind at any given moment-
  and if I get kicked out, set on fire, or sprinkled with holy water, so be it. "
