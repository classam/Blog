  Bread\" />\n<em>This is the first of a many-part series on the proper construction
  of a delicious sandwich. Stay tuned!</em>\n\n<strong>Introduction</strong>\n\nAccording
  to Wikipedia, Tao or Dao is a Chinese character often translated as ‘Way’ or 'Path'.
  The concept of the Tao and its relationship to yin <a title=\"Yin\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin\"
  /> and <a href=\"http://yangman.ca/blog/\">yang</a> heavily influenced chinese philosophy
  and conitinues to to this day. The discourses of sages such as Lao Tsu and Confucious
  traditionally serve as the foundations for understanding the Tao.\n\nThis, however,
  doesn't concern me at all. In fact, this isn't even what I'm talking about. No,
  I'm talking about a different definition of the word \"Tao\" altogether- the construction
  of a fine and delicious sandwich.  Oft-times the word is confused with that of the
  Chinese definition of Tao, but they are nothing alike. One pertains to a cosmic
  balancing of the universe and a philisophical path, wheras the other pertains to
  mustard and it's proper placement on a sandwich.  Thanks to my shortsighted, eurocentric
  view of history and inability to percieve things that <a title=\"For example, this.\"
  href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sly_%26_the_Family_Stone\">happened before 1986</a>
  as 'Real Occurrences', my Tao came first.\n\nSo let us begin.\n\n<strong>Part 1.
  Bread: Your Carbohydrate-Packed Friend\n</strong>\nThe first thing to keep in mind
  when preparing a sandwich is what kind of bread you will be using. The bread, much
  like the canvas of a painting, is not the star: it does, however play an important
  part in the sandwich. In the orchestra of your sandwich, bread is the Piccolo player.
  Nobody really notices he's not there until you have pickles all over your fingers
  and your terrible mixed metaphor is ruined. Or something.\n\n<em>Hey, It's White
  Bread</em>\nYes, we understand- all you have lying around is good ol' fashioned
  White Bread. It contributes nothing to your sandwich, but is a fine base of operations.
  \ Confusing as it may have been at the time (A coronary bypass), my father once
  said to me \"White Bread may not be exciting, but it sure makes a good sandwich.\"\n\nI
  requested that the nurses lower his morphine dosage.\n\n<em>Potato Bread</em>\nPotato
  bread is very similar to white-bread, but it is manufactured from potatoes instead
  of grain.  It has a yellowish hue, and is softer than white-bread. It is recommended
  by the <strong>Canadian Ministry of Potato-Based Breads</strong> <strong>and Keeping
  Don Cherry from Making An Ass Out Of Himself</strong> that you lightly toast potato-bread
  before making it into a sandwich, as it can be too soft to hold a good tomato.\n\n<em>Brown
  Bread (\"Whole Wheat\") </em>\nBrown bread is (usually) made from 100% whole wheat.
  \ This includes the germ and the bran, which are both good for your health.  Brown
  bread has a bit of flavour of its own, which can be good or bad, depending on the
  way you feel about bread.\nTry it- it contains fibre, which will make you happier.\n\n<em>Mixed
  Bread (\"30-70% Whole Wheat\") </em>\nMixed bread is made from white-flour and whole-wheat.
  It's a mix.  For those looking to balance health and Sandwich Deliciousness, this
  is a pretty good compromise.\n<em>\nBread With Weird Things In It (\"Cracked Grain
  Bread\") </em>\nThese breads consist of cracked grain, flaxseed bread, and anything
  else with funny-looking chunks.  These breads are very healthy, but make eating
  a bit of an ordeal, as once in awhile you will bite into a funny chunk.  Be Cautious:
  Funny chunks can ruin certain classes of sandwich.\n\n<em>Bread That Isn't Really
  Bread At All (\"Pita\")\n</em>Although you can make sandwiches with strange breads,
  they really do not fit into the sandwich Tao. Bagels, pitas, tortillas, plates,
  and Brazilian strippers are all things you can eat food off of that aren’t really
  bread.\n\n<em>The Traditional Breads (Rye, Sourdough, Pumpernickel)\n</em>Okay,
  so you're thinking of delving into the world of breads that have flavors.\nTough
  choice, my friend. To use an unwelcome Computer-based metaphor, white and brown
  breads are the Windows XP of your bread-eating world, and Ryes, Sourdoughs and their
  bretheren are the Linuxes: difficult to use properly and oft fickle.\nTrue sandwich
  artisans can claim mastery over the <em>Traditional Breads</em>, but you may want
  to avoid them as they can add many conflicting flavours to a sandwich.\n\n<em>Unsliced
  Bakery Bread: French Bread, Buns & Croissants\n</em>Fresh bakery French bread, buns,
  or croissants truly embody what the Tao of Sandwich is all about: hedonistic consumption
  of vast amounts of unhealthy product-matter.  A white or mixed bread will not interfere
  with the Tao of your sandwich, but something fresh out of the bakery will actually
  add to it.\n\n<em>Wonder Bread\n</em>Quick guideline: Wonder Bread is not actually
  bread. It is a bread-like product. It could be described as 'bread-esque'. It is
  not, however, bread- it was cooked up in some diabolical laboratory, a villainous
  doctor cackling as he's managed to trap the soul of a poor orphaned baguette into
  his steaming, frothing contraption. File it under the category \"Bread that is not
  really bread at all\".\n\n<em>The ancient question: Bakery or Supermarket</em>\nThis
  actually isn't such an ancient question: Buying your bread fresh from a bakery is
  far more awesome than buying it from a supermarket in a bag. By slicing your bread
  by hand, you have more control over the ratio of bread-to-sandwich. Bakeries offer
  choices like 'croissants' (Croissant is French for \"Delicious Buttery Crescent
  For Sandwiches\") or 'Kaiser rolls'. You might get to see a big fat guy wearing
  a chef hat. Dempsters really has nothing on that.\n<em>\nMaking the right choice:
  Pairing your bread with your sandwich.</em>\nThere are certain breads that are only
  compatible with certain types of sandwich.  Take your Peanut Butter & Jelly, for
  example. Served with anything other than white (or off-white) bread, your PB&J sandwich
  is missing an opportunity for optimal fulfillment of your childish desires. Now,
  on the other hand, if you're dealing with a serious, healthy sandwich- something
  featuring 'sprouts' and other such vegetables, and a vinagrette or something, your
  choice is clearly going to be something a little more healthy: Perhaps containing
  flaxseed. Many breads, such as your Ryes, are only really appropriate with sandwiches
  containing high meat-to-bread ratios and obscure cheeses. Be serious about your
  bread selection, but don't be afraid to experiment- you'll never know if you don't
  try.\n<em>\n*Valuable Student Tip</em> - When you're looking for a quick snack,
  and you have something Bakery Fresh, ignore the Tao of Sandwich, and just butter
  it up and eat it. Very quick, vastly unhealthy, and very delicious. Make sure, however,
  to follow the International Buttering Guidelines, outlined further in the Tao of
  Sandwich Guide.\n<strong>\nI have chosen my bread. Now what?</strong>\nWell, you
  can toast your bread, or you can move to Part 2 of the Sandwich Tao: Spreadables.\n\n<strong>Toast:</strong>\n\nToast
  can be tricky, sometimes. If your bread is stale or frozen, toasting is a necessary
  part of sandwich construction, as a microwave will gift you only with soggy, unpleasant
  bread-matter.  If your bread is *too* stale or frozen, I might recommend eating
  something else.  Here are your different grades of toast.\n<em>\nBarely Toasted</em>\nThis
  is a very nice stage for sandwich-making. This is the point where the bread is just
  beginning to toast.  It adds a mild crunch to your sandwich, and some texture to
  the bread, without really being 'toast'- you have 'warm bread with a slight crunch'.\n\n<em>Golden
  Brown</em>\nThis is the next stage of toast.  Golden brown toast is the most common
  stage of toast for the Tao, and should probably be your choice, if you're looking
  into a good sandwich.  Golden brown is also a good toast for breakfasts and long
  walks by the beach. Often, a golden brown toast is still white around the edges,
  just turning a tan-coloured goldish brown around the centre or edges (depending
  on your toaster).\n\n<em>Brown</em>\nA much more developed stage in the toasting
  process.  For all intensive sandwich-making purposes, you are on the verge of going
  too far.  By now, your toast is crispy and crunchy.  The edges are browning.  There
  still will be some white on your toast, however.  Some <a href=\"http://thetoastclub.deviantart.com/\">toast-enthusiasts</a>
  will argue that Brown is the correct toast-level for your sandwich. They are, however,
  wrong, as can be displayed by this <acronym title=\"This link is now broken. It
  was a T-shirt featuring two pieces of toast running from a toaster, yelling 'Shit,
  we're toast!'\" >clever t-shirt</acronym>.\n<em>\nBlack</em>\nYour toast has failed.
  \ It is no longer a delicious derivative of toast, and has now become merely a charcoal
  shadow of it's once glory.  Usually, toast with any kind of black on it is reject-toast,
  and will significantly decrease the Tao of your sandwich. You can still use it,
  if you're cheap or brave, but this toast is far gone. Weep. Weep for the lost toast.\n\n<em>Explosion\n</em>This
  suggests that you have purchased a defective toaster.  Once you grow back your eyebrows
  and learn to once-again trust electronic toasting-machines, I suggest you look for
  toasters that proudly proclaim \"Made In The U.S. of A\" and avoid them like you
  would gonorrhea.\n\n<em>Trenchers: The Precursor to the Sandwich\n</em>From the
  6th century to the 9th century, people would take stale chunks of bread, called
  ‘trenchers’, and pile up meat, cheese, gravy and whatnot on top of them, like plates.
  The trenchers would absorb any dripping gravy, and when the meal was done, the folk
  would either eat them, throw them to their dogs, or give them to poor folk.  Some
  more playful youths would play a game known as \"Trencherball\" which would most-often
  lead to vicious beatings- but then, back in the 6th through 9th centuries, just
  about everything led to vicious beatings.. including:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Blaspheming against
  god (\"Damn these warts!\") (\"The earth rotates around the sun!) (\"Ammonium Perchlorate
  is a terrible way to cleanse yourself of sin!\")</li>\n\t<li>Blaspheming for god
  (\"Damn you, heathens!\")</li>\n\t<li>Failing to clean behind one's ears</li>\n\t<li>Cleaning
  too well behind one's ears (What, is the dirt too good for you?)</li>\n\t<li>Burgling</li>\n\t<li>Three
  Card Monte'</li>\n\t<li>Failing to adhere to the International Buttering Guidelines</li>\n\t<li>Bungling</li>\n\t<li>Drinking
  Mr. Pibb Without a License</li>\n\t<li>Trencherball</li>\n</ul>\n<em>That concludes
  Part 1. Come back later for more discussion on the fine art of sandwich preparation
  when we discuss: Spreadables.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=61\">Part
