  I have often indicated a desire to grow an awesome moustache.  See, now that I''m
  off to Research in Motion to become a Software Develepment Tools Developer (or ''Tool-Software
  Tool Development Tools Software Developer''), I can go about growing some unusual
  facial hair.  I was thinking an English moustache- something that I can wax the
  ends of and curl up. I could then, in "Phase 2", purchase a bowler hat and pipe,
  and twiddle my moustache nervously while blowing bubbles. "Indubitably!", I would
  say in a mock British accent!


  Fun would be had by all. Phase 3 involves a tweed jacket and a pocketwatch.


  Now, as a responsible developer, I have to run the occasional pilot project to test
  the feasibility of such things- so I didn''t shave for a whole 5 days.  Big mistake-
  the hair on my neck grew so thick it gave me a rash, while my upper-lip, sideburn,
  and chin hair was too sparse to be anything more than ugly.  Clearly, the moustache
  dreams are going to have to wait for a slightly older.. me.


  For a summary of why moustaches are both desirable and awesome, I present The Tick:
