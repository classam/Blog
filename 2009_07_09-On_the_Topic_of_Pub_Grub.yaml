  articles expound endlessly on a topic that is completely and utterly ridiculous.</em>\n\nPub
  food has always been pretty much exactly the same, wherever I go.  Compare this
  imaginary pub menu with what you see when you go out to a pub. \n\n<h3>The Mighty

  and salsa - <strong>$14</strong> <small>add meat - $3</small></li>\n<li> <em>3 Tiny
  Spring Rolls</em> - They're stuffed with whatever we couldn't fit into the salad,

  </li>\n<li> <em>Plate of Fries</em> - we put fried potatoes on a plate for you!
  - <strong>$4</strong> </li>\n<li> <em>Yam Fries</em> - how clever! We're the first
  pub ever to come up with the idea of using an alternate sort of potato for our fries!
  Served with our special cajun/chipotle/garlic aioli - <strong>$5</strong> </li>\n<li>
  <em>Calamari</em> - at least, we <em>hope</em> that they're calamari. Served deep-fried
  with tzatziki sauce. - <strong>$10</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Sandwiches</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Super
  Deluxo Hamburger</em> - two big patties, mushrooms, cheese, bacon, a fried egg,

  that we can't accurately identify, on a whole-grain bun with lettuce and tomato
  - <strong> $11 </strong> </li>\n<li> <em> Chicken Wrap </em> - The same breaded

  dressing, and a little bit of foliage, all wrapped in a flour tortilla - <strong>$10</strong>

  <em>Thai Chicken Bowl</em> - In an attempt to seem worldly and exotic, we present
  a bowl of chicken, bean-sprouts, onions, and peppers, drizzled with a sugar-and-sweet-pepper
  sauce that we're trying to pass off as 'Thai'.  - <strong>$14</strong></li>\n<li>
  <em>Fettucini Alfredo</em> - In a sudden, almost lurching attempt to pull people
  out of the exotic land of the <em>far east</em>, we present noodles in a sauce with
  a hint of flavour and all of the cream we could possibly find. - <strong>$14</strong>
  </li>\n<li> <em>Shepherd's Pie</em> - Served by 100% of Britscottirish pubs, and
  by 75% of <em>all remaining pubs</em>. It's a big pile of meat with some potatoes
  and gravy. - <strong>$14</strong> </li> \n</ul>"
