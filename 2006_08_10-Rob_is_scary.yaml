  Rob''s been up to, lately.


  Apparently, what he''s been up to is hijacking my playlist, what with the Ladytron
  and the Kill Bill soundtrack and the Blur and the Richard Cheese.


  Now, I could take this as a sign that he''s evil, or filter through his musical
  choices and try some music that I will probably like. I think I''ll do both.


  Also, Rob is the one to thank for my never, ever imitating JFK from Clone High or
  generating a faux-flaming tone, ever again.Â  I needed to see someone else doing
  it to realize how irritating it can be.'
