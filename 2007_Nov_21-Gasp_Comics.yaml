  It''s been a long time since I''ve posted a comic, or even drawn a comic on a napkin.


  Well, except for the comics that I do on my whiteboard at work all the time.  Meghan
  gives me a ''theme'', and I make a comic on the whiteboard, fun is had by all. But
  those are sadly, lost to history.


  But wait! Just recently, Ian got a BlackBerry with a *camera* in it!


  The theme for <a href="http://curtis.lassam.net/comics/whiteboard/whiteboard-snowman.jpg">this
  one</a> was "Snowmen".'
