content: ! 'My computers were all manufactured in the Czech Republic during the early
  80''s (It was Czechoslovakia, then) by a company named Tatra that also made luxury
  cars and military trucks. Most of them run on a pull-start gasoline engine (not
  unlike a common lawnmower) and get 50 Hz to the litre. My graphics card is just
  a refugee from East Timor with a talent for linear algebra.
