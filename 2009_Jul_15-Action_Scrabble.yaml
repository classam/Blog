content: ! "I played \"Action Scrabble\" for the first time today.\n\nIt was a bit
  ad-hoc.  I made up the rules in my head a good couple of years ago, and I've been
  challenging people to try it ever since- tonight was the first time I ever found
  a taker. \n\nHere's the trick. Every single game of Scrabble I've played, I spend
  the entire game either waiting for somebody to take a laboriously long move, or
  myself trying to take a laboriously long move.  The game is all about spending a
  long, long time perfecting a perfect move.  It's not about 'think fast', it's about
  'optimizing'. \n\nOkay, you have 7 tiles, sitting, in your hands. You haven't turned
  them over yet. GO. \n\nQuickly, put your letters down in the rack. First person
  to come up with a word gets to lay it down for the initial double-word-score bonus.
  \n\nAction Scrabble is not turn based.  As soon as you have a word, you say \"WORD!\",
  lay down your letters, and write your word down on the scorecard - not the score
  for the word, mind you, just the word.  The first person to say \"WORD\" when he
  has a word gets precedence when it comes to placement, but said player must play
  his word immediately and without stalling.  Get your letters. Fast, other players
  can keep playing while you're dilly-dallying.\n\nIf a word is challenged, it stays
  on the board until post-game, where you will be awarded its negative value if you
  fail the challenge. Unless a word is completely implausible (ZYGARF) at which point
  it is removed from the board and you are chastised for being an asscaptain. \n\nOkay,
  everybody has their letters down.  Try to lay them all down- you get negative points
  for tiles left over at the end.  The last player to lay his tiles down must give
  up his tiles to the group- first person to play the tiles gets the points, and those
  tiles STILL penalize the last player! \n\nOkay, game's over.  Score is tallied,
  either from top to bottom or bottom to top of the word list, using standard scoring
  rules.  \n\nYou've just played a game of Action Scrabble. It's like Scrabble, but
  much, much faster.  Incidentally, it's also more fun, at least if you hate the inter-game
  waiting.  \n"
