  purposes, for a project I'm working on.\n\nBut, lo and behold, I discovered the
  unix 'time' function.\n\nJust run <code> time python yourfunction.py </code>, and
  it will merrily run your code, then produce timing data.  It's not just for python,
  it works for any command-line function. \n\nAh, UNIX- whenever I need to do something,
  you've probably already done it, and better."
