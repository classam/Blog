  />\nLast time we covered Breads and Toasting- now we're on to...\n\nPart 2- Spreadables\n\nYes!
  Spreadables are an important part of your sandwich. Butter, mayo, any condiments
  you might add that aren’t very solid. Let’s go through a few.\n<em>\nButter/Margarine</em>\nAh,
  the endless debate. Which will reign supreme? Butter? Margarine? Nobody really knows.
  Margarine features easy spreadability and doesn’t change much with the temperature.
  Butter tends to have more flavour.  The most Tao choice of them all is whipped butter,
  with both spreadability and flavour, but that tends only to be available at fancy
  restaurants in little packets.  Remember; pirate a few packets for future Sandwich
  Tao!  As margarine is our choice, whenever I say ‘butter’, I secretly mean ‘margarine’.
  Remember the code.  This leads us to our next little sidebar…\n<strong>\nThe Secret
  Ninja Art of Margarine Spreading</strong>\n\nMargarine spreading is a tough business,
  but if you take some time with it, you, too, can become a <strong>Master of The
  Secret Ninja Art of Margarine Spreading</strong>.  Take your bread, or toast, or
  bun, and prepare your buttering knife (always use a butter knife, fool!) don’t take
  too much butter at one time- you must never return crumby butter to the container.
  \ Spread the butter thinly and evenly, and to all corners.  Do not spread the butter
  so thick that it is a visible layer in your sandwich. You want your margarine layer
  to be thin, like the reeds in the forest, or the grasshopper’s... uh... leg, or
  something. You can lay on the other spreadables as thick as you like, but margarine
  must be a very thin layer.  If you are spreading margarine on hot toast, it will
  melt as you spread it. Do not spread more margarine on an already melted layer.
  This will guarantee you a quick and dishonourable death.  Soon, the uninitiated
  will fear your skills in <strong>The Secret Ninja Art of Margarine Spreading</strong>.\n\n<em>Mustard</em>\nOh,
  mustard. Mustard, mustard, mustard.  Remember, mustard gas is not edible; it is
  a mixture of chlorine, sulphur, and ethylene. It’s colourless, and causes severe
  blistering and blindness.  We’re not talking about that, though. We’re talking about
  Mustard, the yellow stuff.  It has quite a kick to it, and you have to try it to
  know what I mean. You can buy it in big tubs, and spread it manually (always use
  a butter knife, fool!), or get the containers with the squeeze-top.  If you go for
  the squeeze-top, always remember to close the top and shake the container upside-down
  before you squeeze it out, else you will get mustard-juice (uck) on your sandwich.
  Another mustard-freeing move is the ‘Elvis’, where you close the top and spin the
  Mustard container around and around in circles, tip-out, until all of the mustard
  moves to the end. It’s a bit gaudy, but fun. Try it.\nMustard is a favourite of
  ham-based sandwiches everywhere.\n<em>\nFancy-Pants Mustards</em>\nHoney-Mustard
  and Dijon-Mustard both fall into these categories, and they elicit pretty much the
  same set of warnings and comments, with the additional comment that Honey-Mustard
  is the mustard-of-choice for chicken or turkey based sandwiches (should you choose
  those over ham sandwiches for some reason.)\n\n<em>Hot Mustard</em>\nWhile 'Hot
  Mustard' may sound like the name of a moustachioed porn star, it is actually a spicy
  and delicious addition to your sandwiches.  It's got some serious bite to it- like
  wasabi or horseradish, it's to be used in moderation, perhaps even tag-teaming with
  a milder mustard alternative. \n\n<em>Mayonnaise</em>\nMayonnaise is an ‘emulsion’
  created by the blending of eggs and oil, and therefore is very fatty. It adds creaminess
  and deliciousitude to your sandwich.  Miracle Whip™ is a sub-class of mayonnaise,
  known for its “Tangy Zip” ™. The choice between Miracle Whip and normal Mayonnaise
  is a very deep and personal one, more important to the followers of the Sandwich
  Tao than religion or politics.  Miracle Whip™ tends to be tangier, Mayonnaise creamier.
  Mayo should be spread to all corners of the sandwich, and applied to the piece of
  bread opposite the margarine to ensure even coverage and sandwich-lubrication.  If
  you come across a mayo-bottle with a squeeze-top, use it to your advantage and adopt
  a Subway™ style of mayo-coverage, which is a thin line- zigzag across your sandwich;
  or make hilarious clown-face patterns. Your call.\n<em>\nCheez-Whiz™ (And other
  Cheez products)</em>\nDanger! Danger! Cheez-Whiz™ is very strongly cheese flavoured,
  and a dangerous addition to any sandwich.  Fear the cheez, for it is cheez, not
  cheese.  You can apply Cheez-Whiz™ directly to toast for a quick snack, as long
  as you don’t mind being called ‘trailer-trash’ or a ‘slack-jawed yokel’.\nIn general,
  cheez of any sort is not to be considered an adequate substitute for cheese.\n<em>\nHorseradish</em>\nDon’t
  put horseradish or wasabi (Japanese Nuclear Horseradish) on a sandwich. Completely
  inappropriate choice of topping for your everyday sandwich.  There are some sandwiches
  which involve the use of horseradish. Avoid them studiously, unless they are prepared
  by licensed sandwich professionals, and keep a strong drink at the ready in case
  the sandwich is unpalatable.\n<em>\nKetchup</em>\nNo. Just… no. Ketchup, and it's
  BBQ-sauce based bretheren have no place in sandwiches- they are, however, welcome
  in the sandwich's close cousin: The Hamburger.\n\n<em>Peanut Butter & Jelly, the
  Dynamic Duo</em>\nAs spreadables go, these are the only ones that can make a sandwich
  one with the Tao on their own. Very powerful spreadables, these. Quick, simple,
  and delicious. Uncomplicated. Merely spread any amount of peanut butter and/or jelly
  on toast.  Peanut butter is good without jelly, jelly is good without peanut butter
  (but just-jelly is better with margarine) Peanut Butter can also be served with
  Bananas, or Honey, or an admixture of all sorts of sweet sandwichplaceables. You
  can apply a layer of margarine first, before the PB&J combo, but not on toast; the
  saltiness of melted butter interferes with the sweetness of the peanut butter and
  jelly. Peanut butter IS sweet, not salty. You can also add cheese to the PB&J, although
  it is a risky move.  Due to it’s malleability, PB&J can be served Open-Faced (on
  one slice of bread), Half-Faced (on one slice of bread, folded over) or Two-Faced
  (attached to the villain from Batman Forever played by Tommy Lee Jones)\nWarning:
  Do not under ANY circumstances mix PB&J with any other spreadables. Mustard, cheese,
  ketchup, or horseradish will do terrible and sacrilegious things to this duo.\n\n<em>Gravy</em>\n\"But
  goodsir- gravy is not a spreadable product!\" - Ah, young one, you have yet to learn.
  \ While hot gravy can be poured within a turkey sandwich (if it's turkey gravy)
  or roast beef sandwich (if it's roast beef) such a gravy can render the sandwich
  sopping wet and difficult to eat. Proper bread choice and sandwich construction
  can make this a viable choice-and delicious, too. However, before you start heating
  up your gravy, listen to this: Gravy can be applied cold to a sandwich as well,
  in a state often as spreadable as mayonnaise.\n\n<em>If the Navy gets the Gravy
  and the Army gets the Beans, what do the Air Force and the National Guard get?\n</em>Corn-on-the-cob
  and kegs of beer, respectively.\n\n<em>Vaseline</em>\nDon’t put this on your sandwich.
  \ Listen to “She Don’t Use Jelly” by The Flaming Lips, if you want to exercise your
  right to enjoy the combo of lubricant and toast. The only excuse for eating the
  stuff is accidental ingestion, and the only excuse for accidental ingestion is…
  well… you figure it out on your own.\n<em>\nVegemite</em>\nSee Vaseline.\n\n<em>Nutella\n</em>Nutella
  is a combination of chocolate and hazelnuts, and it's good- albeit very, very, very
  sweet. Try at your own risk.\n\n<em>Salt & Pepper\n</em>While not technically 'spreadables',
  salt & pepper really fail to fall into any category.  Salt & Pepper make a nice
  addition to sandwiches, especially those featuring cheese or tomatoes. Freshly ground
  pepper tends to have a more pronounced flavor- use it. (Do you not have a pepper
  mill? Okay, you're exempt.)\n\nThat concludes Part 2: Spreadables.\nReturn soon
