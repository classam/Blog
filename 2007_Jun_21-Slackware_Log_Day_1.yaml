  />\n\nI have recently (perhaps foolishly) decided to start running Slackware as
  my primary Linux partition.\n\"But Curtis!\", my friends mutter (at least those
  friends who aren't Phil or Travis), \"You must be insane!\".\nNo, no, I'm not insane.
  I wasn't using the Ubuntu partition anyways- For day to day, 'easy' computing, I
  have Windows, which shockingly *IS* a good operating system.. when subjected to
  enough arm-twisting.\nSo I have my comfortable, easy user-experience down pat, and
  I want something painful and horrible that will force me to learn- Think of Slackware
  as the OS equivalent to \"The Bradley Bart Course\" (A great learning experience
  that may be painful at times) \n\nSo, here we go.\n\n<strong>1. </strong>Installed
  <a title=\"Slackware\" href=\"http://www.slackware.com/\">Slackware </a>to the Linux
  and Linux Swap partitions that I was neglecting for Ubuntu.  Remembered (after some
  brief confusion) that the Laptop has <a title=\"Wikipedia: Serial Advanced Technology
  Attachment\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATA\">SATA</a> drives, so instead
  of dealing with \"hda\", I'd be dealing with \"sda\". Slackware cleverly chose sata.i
  as the default kernel so that it booted properly without my having to remember that.
  \nRations are plentiful and morale is high amongst the troops- this expedition might
  make it!\n\n2. Formatted Linux partition. Briefly felt clever- I know what inodes
  are! Ha! Take that, block of earlier un-had knowledge! Entertained myself as the
  formatting occurred by playing the spoons.  \n\n3. Given the choice whether to install
  the whole system in one fell swoop or choose packages individually, I opted for
  the full installation- With 40 gigabytes allocated to the Linux Partition, I've
  got space to burn. Watched the packages go by, reading the names and descriptions
  of the slower ones as they installed. Hello, <a title=\"Wikipedia: GNU Compiler
  Collection\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection\">GCC</a>!
  Ooh, <a title=\"Wikipedia: Network Map\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nmap\">NMAP</a>,
  might find a use for that! TCP/IP? Can't run a computer without that little nugget
  of joy! It even automatically mounted my <a title=\"Wikipedia: New Technology File
  System\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS\">NTFS</a> Windows and <a title=\"Wikipedia:
  File Allocation Table\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAT32\">FAT32</a> Media
  partitions! (The FAT32 Partition is there so that both OSes can read/write music
  and documents.) \n\n4. Installed <a title=\"Wikipedia: Linux Loader\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LILO\">LILO</a>
  to Master Boot Record, where <a title=\"Wikipedia: Grand Unified Bootloader\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRUB\">GRUB</a>
  was before.  Didn't have to perform any voodoo to make Windows appear first in the
  list of Operating Systems. Morale still high! Strongly considering some self-congratulatory
  champagne.\n\n5. Booted. Internet doesn't seem to work? Checked <a title=\"Wikipedia:
  Interface Configurator\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifconfig\">ifconfig</a>
  to see what was up and noticed that eth0 was completely missing. Deeply puzzled,
  I threw rocks at the computer, hoping it would solve my problem- to no avail.\n\n6.
  Brief nap.\n\n7. Checked /etc/rc.d/rc.modules. Hunted around as per the <a title=\"The
  Slackbook\" href=\"http://www.slackbook.org/\">Slack Manual</a> instructions.  Saw
  a tonne of options, and came to the conclusion that I'd need more information on
  my ethernet card before continuing. Tried yelling at rc.modules, but accomplished
  nothing.\n\n8. Booted back into Windows. Hunted down some documentation on my Laptop's
  specific model- It's a <a title=\"Compaq Presario V6105NR\" href=\"http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?product=3250961&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&lang=en&cc=us#\">Compaq
  Presario V6105NR</a>, and the ethernet card is an '<a title=\"Intel Pro/100 VE\"
  href=\"http://www.intel.com/support/network/adapter/pro100/pro100venet/index.htm\">Intel
  Pro/100 VE</a>'. Great! That should help me solve my problem! Morale once again
  high!\n\n9. Booted back into Linux. After some hair-pulling and gnashing of teeth,
  used 'modinfo' to discover that the correct module to use should probably be 'e100'.
  Trying '<a title=\"Wikipedia: Modprobe\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modprobe\">modprobe</a>
  e100' to insert the desired module into the kernel fails. More hair-pulling and
  gnashing of teeth. \n\n10. I note that my kernel is still 2.4.. maybe updating the
  old kernel might help? According to <a title= \"Intel Pro/100 VE\" href=\"http://www.intel.com/support/network/adapter/pro100/pro100venet/index.htm\">the
  website for the network card</a>, it's supposed to support the 2.6 Kernel.  Booted
  into Windows, downloaded latest 2.6 kernel, Booted into Slack, unzipped it into
  /lib/src/..\n\n11. Read instructions in the <a title=\"Slackbook\" href=\"http://www.slackbook.org/\">Slackbook</a>.
  \ Invoked 'make <a title=\"Wikipedia: Menuconfig\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menuconfig\">menuconfig</a>'.
  Hunted through options and made sure 'e100' support was compiled right into the
  Kernel. I mean, the thing's part of my laptop, it's not going anywhere. Right?\n\n12.
  'make bzImage'. Discovered that my computer can compile a kernel pretty darn quickly.
  During this process, I once again reference the process for moving a foreground
  process into the background (Ctrl-Z, followed by 'bg'.) Briefly ruminate on the
  fact that this is probably the tenth time I've <a title=\"Moving a foreground process
  into the background\" href=\"http://www-hermes.desy.de/Unixhelp/shell_jobz3.2.html\">looked
  it up on the internet</a>.\n\n13. Tossed <a title=\"Wikipedia: Vmlinux\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzimage\">bzImage</a>
  into boot, moved the 2.4 Kernel into bzImage.old (as a much-needed backup)\n\n14.
  Added '2.6' and '2.4' options to /etc/lilo.conf so that I could load either 2.6
  or 2.4.. rebooted the computer, and there were still only the options of Windows
  and Linux. I guessed that I must have missed a step.\n\n15. Oh, in order to save
  the settings in lilo.conf, you have to run 'lilo'. Silly me. Once again feelin'
  pretty sexy- Yeah, *I'm* compiling a Kernel. Ha! It's not that hard!\n\n15. Reboot.
  \ Try 2.6, and am happy to have kept '2.4' as a boot option, because 2.6 fails to
  display anything whatsoever. I consider taking up heavy drinking as a less stressful
  sport.\n\n16. Reboot, back into 2.4. Hunt around online for support (using convenient
  terminal next to computer).  Find some persons online talking about how their fresh
  compile of 2.6 results in a blank screen. (Oh! I have that problem!) Someone points
  out that the '<a title=\"Wikipedia: Framebuffer\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer\">framebuffer</a>
  support' options have to be set when compiling the kernel.  \n\n17. 'make menuconfig'
  again. Hunted around for framebuffer options- I figured something to do with display
  options or something? Eventually find it in Device Drivers -> Graphic Options, and
  select Framebuffer, Framebuffer->VESA, Framebuffer->VGA (16-Bit) and Framebuffer->i810
  (Because the graphics card in this computer is a Intel GMA 950, which uses the i810
  driver.)\n\n18. During this process, symlinked /usr/bin/<a title=\"Wikipedia: Pico
  Text Editor\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_%28text_editor%29\">pico</a>
  to /usr/bin/<a title=\"Wikipedia: Nano Text Editor\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nano_%28text_editor%29\">nano</a>
  so that I could invoke my crappy little Linux text editor without having to think
  about using pico instead of nano. Firmly resolve to make either emacs or vim 'my
  bitch' in the near future. \n\n19. 'make bzImage'.  Rapid compilation occurs. Copied
  bzImage into boot (rewriting the last version) and rebooted, hoping for the best.
  \n\n20. 2.6 still fails. While in the empty, screenless mode, I type in (blind)
  'root', the password, and then '<a title=\"Wikipeda: Shutdown\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutdown\">halt</a>'.
  The computer happily comes to a stop, suggesting that, while the display may work,
  at least it's not hiding a kernel panic or something. Strongly consider throwing
  my laptop at an orphan.\n\n21. Give up for the day. Resolve to come back and fight
  again later. Drunkenly curse at computer, then stagger off into the distance. "
