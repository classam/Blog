  more-expensive white model.  Thank YOU, Tax Refund. \n\nI'm just now deeply engrossed
  in my usual process of installing important software.  \nI know for Windows, I'd
  die horribly without PuTTY, FileZilla and to a lesser extent TortoiseSVN. The CreativeSuite
  pack and OpenOffice are also my long-time friends\n\nI'm wondering, Mac users out
  there- what is your essential Mac software? You know - the stuff that you just can't
  live without. \n"
