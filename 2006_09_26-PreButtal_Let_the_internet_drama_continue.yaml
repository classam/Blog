content: ! 'Dock- I made a concerted effort. I produced a humour page that I was happy
  with. I wished that more talented cartoonists, writers, or illustrators submitted
  comics or came to my ''comic jams'', but they didn''t. Over the semester, I kept
  most of the material that I felt was of poor quality out of the Peak, barring some
  filler on my part- So I feel that I did an ok job.  It wasn''t great, I''ll admit-
  there weren''t enough cartoonists to make it great, and I didn''t have a lot of
  time to pull the page together and last-but-not-least, my sense of humour just doesn''t
  jive with some people.


  Now, what I''m saying is that I disagree with Kellen''s policies of putting WingNuts
  back in the Peak, and putting Warren''s Dream back in the Peak. WingNuts is sadly
  in need of .. some sort of punchline at the end, and some sort of streamlining to
  make it readable- But the team responsible for WingNuts actually can produce some
  top-notch one-shot political-ish comics for the benefit of the Opinions page. Warren''s
  Dream and Kellen''s Dream both have an almost Terry Gilliam-esque "What the fuck
  is the point of this?" kind of style that would be fantastic as a method of cutting
  from scene-to-scene in a movie but doesn''t make any sort of sense in the context
  of the humour page.


  What happened to No Fools? I know Dylan Innes and Elaine Gebert are still making
  comics, and they are a talented SFU-Native comic-duo.  From what I hear from Dylan,
  Kellen wouldn''t run his comics just due to the format that they tried to send them
  in- A poor excuse, at best.  Even if there is a good excuse, I can''t see why the
  two of them aren''t being pursued. <a href="nofools.livejournal.com">No Fools</a>
  is *the bees knees*.


  Webcomics? Yeah, they are a narrow line. You wouldn''t want to put a comic in the
  Peak that everybody can read on the internet. But you also wouldn''t want to put
  a comic in the Peak that nobody would read on the internet even if they had a chance-
  good webcomics tend to really high quality. Whenever I ask somebody what they liked
  about the humour section, I get a pretty high instance of "Almost Evil" or "Hey,
  who wrote that one with the flower?"- So I don''t see a problem with a percentage
  of web content: The real crutch is limiting yourself to student submissions in lieu
  of quality.


  Penny-Arcade ripoff, Kellen? Okay, I''ll admit I''ve taken some stylistic cues from
  Gabe @ PA, just like I''ve tried to learn a bit about comics from any and all webcomics
  I''ve read. Tiny necks.. check. Shirts? check. Comics-from-the-waist-up? Check.
  Yeah, we have all of the classic signs of a PA-influenced comic. But the line between
  PA-influenced and PA-plagiarizing is a wide one, and I''m constantly trying to improve
  to the point where I have an identifiable style and people are accusing others of
  ripping *me* off. Dr. Googaw certainly never appeared in Penny Arcade, and there
  are points where my style is distinctly different from PA (Usually for the worse,
  but hey, I''m young and impetuous) I believe that if you had a problem with Penny
  Arcade Influenced content, you''d have a problem with Chris Baxter and Brian Shirlaw-
  who self admittedly "are a blatant ripoff of Penny Arcade with Canadian content!"
  (That''s from february 28, 2005, which is a long fuckin'' time ago, but their style
  hasn''t changed too much). I don''t have a problem with Chris Baxter and Brian Shirlaw,
  you don''t have a problem with Chris Baxter and Brian Shirlaw, ergo, you can''t
  have a problem with me... at least in terms of my work''s'' *PASSING* similarity
  to Penny Arcade. You can still have a problem with me because I''m an asshole, which
  is by no means something I plan to deny.


  Kellen, as a humour editor, you''re going to have to learn to take some criticism. 
  Heck, thanks to the fact that interest in the humour page is low (as always) and
  satirical (as always), Humour Editors don''t have to deal with one tenth the crap
  that the other editors have to deal with.  The other members of the Peak staff,
  hardworking and diligent as they are, have been attacked, taunted, sued, mocked,
  disagreed-with and otherwise denigrated more than you or I with our delicate turn-criticism-away-with-humour
  psyches could probably deal with.   A few people predicting the end of the world
  based on Warren''s Dream reappearing in The Peak should not be enough to get your
  pants in a tangle, even if it''s on the *GASP* internet.


  And finally, North California? No wonder.
