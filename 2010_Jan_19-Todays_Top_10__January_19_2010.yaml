content: ! "Ugh. This 'top-10' thing is really taking it out of me.  Seriously, nothing
  interesting happened on the internet today.  Might as well just go home. \n\n<h3>Number
  10: Honeydew Bubble Tea </h3>\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/wi4Zl.jpg\">Bubbles</a>!\n\n<h3>Number
  9: CS Unplugged </h3>\nCS Unplugged presents <a href=\"http://csunplugged.com/\">a
  bunch of activities</a> that would be great for preparing students for a technical
  education.  I'll reserve my opinion on \"Computing Science isn't really about Computers
  at all!\" for another day, but needless to say I consider it akin to saying that
  \"Biology isn't really about living things at all! We just love categorizing shit!\"\n\n<h3>Number
  8: God Can Noscope </h3>\nSo, apparently, a weapons manufacturer for the U.S. has
  been inscribing bible passages on rifle scopes. <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/01/19/if-thy-rifle-scope-offends-thee-pluck-it-out/\">
  Yikes</a>. \n\n<h3>Number 7: Korea Lets Digital Companies Print Their Own Money
  </h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2010/01/19/korean-court-legaliz.html\">This
  thing</a>, here. \n\n<h3>Number 6: Mesa Digital Guitar </h3>\nIf you have not seen
  this badass guitar, you should see <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2eiP12hQQY&feature=autoshare\">this
  badass guitar</a>. \n\n<h3>Number 5: SMBC On Time Travel </h3>\nWhere are all the
  <a href=\"http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=1766\">time travelers</a>?\n\n<h3>Number
  4: Schneier On China </h3>\nBruce Schneier takes <a href=\"http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/01/google_vs_china.html\">a
  very brief look at the Google Vs. China thing</a>, but the paydirt is in hilarious
  hypocrisy from the U.S. government. \n\n<h3>Number 3: Nedroid </h3>\nNedroid: <a
  href=\"http://nedroid.com/2010/01/change-of-scenery/\">Still Funny Today</a>. \n\n<h3>Number
  2: Chainsawsuit </h3>\nKris Straub says<a href=\"http://chainsawsuit.com/2010/01/19/jimmy-fallon/\">
  the only funny thing to date </a>about the Conan/Leno thing. \n\n<h3>Number 1 :
  Office's Ugly New Icons </h3>\nIt would seem that one thing that office's UI designers
  have going for them is consistency... at least, until now, when they <a href=\"http://blog.cocoia.com/2010/office-trouble/\">break
  their old designs for Office 2010</a>. \n"
