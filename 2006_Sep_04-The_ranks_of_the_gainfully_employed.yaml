  -----------------------------------

  So, I was just recently hired at <a href="http://www.newcityfilms.com/">New City</a>.
  Yay co-op! It''s a start-up- which is a combination of excitement, hard work, and
  .. more hard work.  I''m happy to have a job, doubly happy to have a job in a relaxed
  atmosphere like the one I met at New City- and a little nervous because I''m not
  sure if I''m ready for such a responsibility.  It''s a first-job thing, I guess.  I''m
  in their files, I signed an NDA, and it''s all official.


  What am I doing? I''m a web dev., working on <a href="http://www.movieset.com/">movieset.com</a>.
  It''s a big project and a small team, and I can''t wait to get started.


  Just as soon as I learn the language that this thing is being built in...



  (This Saturday)

  ----------------------------


  My, oh, my, this new job is exhausting.  I haven''t had a chance to update my site,
  or talk to people, or read my favourite comics, or any of my favourite pastimes-
  all week.

  Being that I signed an NDA, I''m not going to share anything too specific..


  The concept of movieset.com is fantastic, and everybody I''m working with is very
  good at what they do- I sit next to Kent Clark, our new graphics guy, and he produces
  awesome photoshop goodies like I produce embarassing faux-pas.

  The working conditions are very close- I work with the basement team (In a basement).
  That''s good, because I like all of my co-workers.. but sometimes it''s impossible
  to get good work done when there''s a conversation going on behind you.  I put on
  my headphones (big open cans, mmm) and crank music to actually work on something
  hard.  I think <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/Archive.html">Joel Spolsky</a>
  is right when he talks about getting into "The Zone"- I was more productive in the
  hour before work with the music cranked up to high than I was the whole rest of
  the day- albeit, much of my lost productivity is due to our site''s totally haX0red
  code.

  The site''s designed so that directors can easily make their own sub-websites without
  much of a hassle, so it''s all designed around an expensive content management system
  that was designed (and is still in design) by another company.  Working with the
  CMS is kludgy, and nothing ever seems to work the way it should- which is frustrating.  The
  CMS is so unnecessarily complex and poorly documented, that in order to show people
  how to work with it properly, they have to send them for a one-week training course
  at great cost to our company.  So, it''s frustrating for me to work with- but as
  a plus, when directors want to add content to their sites, it will be easy-as-pie
  for them. (I hope)

  So, long story short: I''ve found a company, and I enjoy working there because the
  people are great and the atmosphere is great and the project is new and fantastic
  and interesting.  My only complaints revolve around my long commute, low wages,
  long hours, and frustrating site architecture- but isn''t it all worth it to be
  working on something so interesting?


  So, everybody who''s missed me- I''m going to try to get my hours under control,
  streamline my day so that I can actually have some free time to spend with y''all.
  After that, there''s always weekends. Hooray for weekends!'
