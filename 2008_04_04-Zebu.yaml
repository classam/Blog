content: ! "I made it exactly one sentence into Philip K. Dick's \"Do Androids Dream
  of Electric Sheep\".\n\nThe first sentence of the foreword by Roger Zelazny. That's
  as far as I got. \n\n\"Once there was a man who repaired trash compactors because
  that was what he loved doing more than anything else in the world.\" \n\nThat's
  interesting.  I wanted to know more about this man.  I read a little further, but
  it wasn't about him at all.  I couldn't progress any further than this trash compactor
  repairman.\n\nSo I pulled out LyX and wrote a <a href=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/projects/zebu.pdf\">story</a>
  about him. \n\nIt's long, and you don't need to read it unless you've got a thing
  for (exceedingly) amateur science fiction. I'll run it by Sarah to proof it later-
  not the Sarah that you know, the Sarah that I know. \n\nI can't believe I had a
  sudden urge to write a short sci-fi story about a trash-compactor-repairman.  \n<ul>\n<li>
  I've never written sci-fi before. </li>\n<li> I've never written a short-story before.
  </li>\n<li> I don't know anything about trash-compactor repair. </li>\n</ul>\n\nI
  suspect that my incredibly short attention span and high levels of impulsiveness
  are eventually going to lead me to the limits of the interesting things that a human
  being can do in the 2 hours before whatever it is gets boring and something else
  catches his attention."
