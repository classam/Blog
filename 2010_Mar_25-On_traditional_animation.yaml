  articles cover a topic near and dear to my heart: Making things look pretty. </em>\n\nOnce
  I have time to myself again, I'd like to make a video game. \n\nNot a huge production,
  just a little easy Flash game, the sort of thing that everybody tosses together
  at one point or another.   \n\nOne thing I find about a lot of Flash games, though,
  is that they seem stilted and awkward.  The graphics always have that 'made-in-flash'
  sheen to them, and the animation has that 'awkward automatically-tweened' feel to
  them. \n\nSo, I thought I'd experiment with 'real animation', you know, the old
  fashioned kind where you draw every frame. In my case, I drew every frame... in
  Illustrator.  So that made things a little easier. \n\nFirst things first - a <a
  href=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/projects/walky.png\">lot of frames</a> need to be
  drawn, and consistency - an area where I'm notably pretty weak - is key.  However,
  I'm thinking that, for more detailed work, so long as the hips are covered by whatever
  the protagonist is wearing and the feet can be visually separated from the legs
  (with boots, maybe) - the whole process can be made much faster with good ol' fashioned
  copying and pasting.  With a little bit of programming ingenuity, I could probably
  mount 'static' props (hat, shirt) on to a base model (like this one), or arms (definitely
  need arms)...\n\nWell, for the first animation, I had the whole thing animated 'on
  twos' - every second frame - and it looked like <a href=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/projects/walky.swf\">this</a>.
  \ Jumpy, right?  Things smoothed considerably when I filled in all of the <a href=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/projects/walky2.swf\">inbetweens</a>.
  \ \n\nWhile time-consuming, it was also pretty fun.  I'm going to be fiddling with
  this some more. "
