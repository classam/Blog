content: ! "HEY! FUCK YOU! \n\nOkay, that was a bit startling, but when you spend
  your time connected with everybody else on the planet, having entertainment constantly
  piped directly into your brain-stem, one must be shocking to stand out.\n\nWe don't
  have long for introductions before you lose interest and move on to the next thing.
  I'm J. Random Hacker, the newest columnist for the Vancouver Afternoon Alternative
  Hacker 18-35 newsfeed - remember, that's VAAH - \"We got your fuckin' news right
  here, punk.\" You might have heard of me - I covered the Surrey data riots six years
  ago.  Some might argue that I caused the Surrey data riots six years ago, and to
  those readers I say that you can prove nothing. \n\nWhy am I qualified for the position?
  \ Here's why &mdash; I know you. If you're reading this, demographically, you're
  a 18-35-year-old hacker, with a hacker wife and hacker children.  You've got 30K
  worth of wiring in your head and on your hands, and a freshly brewed coffee steaming
  next to your desk. You have three personal projects on the go &mdash; games or applications
  &mdash; they're going to revolutionize the wetware industry, and that'll buy you
  a ticket out of your dead-end hacking job.  You're currently in the middle of six
  newsfeeds, four comic-strips, a tv show, and the latest track. \n\nAnd I'm one of
  you. \n\nSome of the newsfeeds even covered me, in my day.  Surprise trillionaire!
  Wrote the next big thing in wetware and sold it to BusinessPeople for enough money
  to retire early.  Everybody bought a copy of Kiosk, BusinessPeople sucked all of
  the fun out of it, and now it's just another Human Management Tool.  The only difference
  is that now I never need to scratch out shitty code for relatively unknown companies
  in exchange for security and better technology to lodge under my skin. \n\nSo I
  loaf, and I code, and I write articles for anybody willing to publish them.\n\nLove
  & Kisses &mdash; J. Random Hacker"
