  Sushi\" />\n\nFrom time to time, I receive an e-mail from Helium.com- some sort
  of automated message to let me know that some new feature or contest is available
  to me. \n\nWhat is Helium? Well, it's difficult to describe. It's an online 'magazine'
  of sorts, with preset article topics that people can write articles for.  Topics
  exist across a number of categories- from \"What is the best way to protect my computer\",
  to \"Pros and Cons of Online Pharmacies\".  Writers then read through articles and
  rank them- this article is better than that article, this article is better than
  that article, etcetera.  The higher-ranked articles are then the most likely to
  'make money', appear on the front page, or win the user points towards contests
  (where the top prize can be as much as $75!).\n\nNow, at first, it seems like a
  great scam because they're getting tonnes of people writing for them for some very
  low costs.  They can generate all of the content that they want for free and then
  profit off of ads and such. The writers, at least, can make a little bit of money
  and maybe get their writings viewed by more people than usual.\n\nBut after a short
  while you realize that that's not Helium's business model at all.  In fact, the
  only audience that Helium has at all.. are the writers themselves.  The articles
  at Helium are largely and overwhelmingly of poor quality.  The pre-approved, limited
  range of topics means that articles are largely boring and samey, and that writers
  are constantly writing the same things over and over again.  If you go to Helium's
  front page, or sign up with Helium, the entire brunt of the site's dynamic seems
  to be \"Hey! Write for us!\".\n\nSo, the entire Helium community is comprised of
  writers all-but jerking off to their own words, and competing for small prizes based
  on said writings.  Which, when it comes down to it, is a decent enough community-
  at least enough to bring in some ad revenue for lucky Helium. Is it enough, though,
  to justify the lavish contests and apparently expensive development of the site?
  It looks like VC is being blown at an astonishing rate on this project, and I find
  myself wondering if their business model is going to hack it.\n\nWell, it worked
  for thisisby.us ... it could work for Helium. Let's wait and see!"
