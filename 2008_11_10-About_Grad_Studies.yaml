  barely pass undergraduate university courses </li>\n<li> Work in \"the field\" for
  several years. </li> \n<li> Eventually grow bored with professional programming.
  </li>\n<li> Return to academia, get more degree. Become a cranky old professor with
  an incredibly obscure specialty. </li> \n</ul>\n\nI always figured that this plan
  was technically sound- but now that I look closer, I wonder if schools looking for
  grad students will accept field experience in lieu of an actual decent GPA or research
  experience.  Any insight, interwebs?"
