content: ! "So, <a href=\"http://fri.endcode.net\">fri.endcode</a> is shaping up nicely.\n\nI
  was really hoping I'd have more time to devote to the project, that Ryan and Sepand
  would have more time to devote to it, too- it still needs so much work to even start
  to feel like a real, useful tool.  Certainly it's not going to get that far over
  the long weekend, which will be the last time we work on it as a team. \n\nI suppose
  if I have to compromise on the features and functionality, I must at least maintain
  a high standard of craftsmanship with what we *do* end up putting in.  And by a
  high standard of craftsmanship, I mean *more work on the stylesheet*. \n\nDo I keep
  working on it after the semester is over?  I don't know.  I was never really sold
  on the idea in the first place- Social Networking really does suffer from the chicken-and-egg
  problem of 'where are all the users going to come from?'. I think it best just to
  polish fri.endcode into a portfolio piece and move on. "
