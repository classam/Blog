  brooding.  Don't want to work <a title=\"Electronic Arts\" href=\"http://jobs.ea.com/\">there</a>,
  don't want to work <a title=\"Microsoft\" href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/canada/employment/default.mspx\">there</a>,
  especially don't want to work <a title=\"Rocket Games\" href=\"http://www.rocketgaming.com/\">there</a>.
  \ I chatted a few representatives up- but whenever I started to go into my lust
  for <a title=\"Python\" href=\"http://www.python.org/\">beautiful</a>, <a title=\"Ruby\"
  href=\"http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\">beautiful</a>, <a title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"http://javascript.crockford.com/javascript.html\">beautiful</a>,
  scripting languages, they all replied with the same stock line: \"Oh, you're into
  scripting? Well, we do mostly more mainstream stuff- Java, C#- but we've got some
  Perl development going...\". That's my cue to exit.\n\nThe reason the Obfuscated
  Perl contest shut down, I'll postulate, is that one year the code that one of the
  judges wrote to automatically test-interpret contest entries was accidentally submitted...
  and won.\n\nAnd then the inspiration hit me.  When I had first heard of this year's
  OpFair, I had wanted to set up a booth of my own, so as to represent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture_Science\">Aperture
  Science</a>.  There was going to be a poster and everything.\n\nI frantically looked
  around for some booths, but they were all full. Curses!\n\nI had forgotten, and
  was disappointed. I explained this to <a title=\"Her Evil Majesty Is From The Internets\"
  href=\"http://blag.daybinge.org/?p=12\">Her Evil Majesty</a>, and she thought that
  we might be able to nab a booth at the end of the day, while everybody was cleaning
  up.  She was right- we nabbed the Sophos booth just as they left.   We sat down
  a while- she had a professional looking pen, I had a bottle with another company's
  logo on it, and we were both looking rather sciencey- me in my collared shirt and
  sweater, Her Evil Majesty in her.. um.. evil clothes? \n\n.. We didn't have much
  time. Everybody was packing up.  I grabbed the first person I saw- a somewhat dapper
  looking asian guy in a suit.  \"Would you be interested in a career with Aperture
  Science?\".\n\nIt started off well.  We were, at first, curious if he had heard
  of us. \"A little market research\", I quipped.  I explained that we're working
  on a rather revolutionary operating system, the Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating
  System.  Her Evil Majesty chimed in with \"GLaDoS!\" \n\n\"We've also done some
  work with shower curtain technology, and a few other things. We do a lot of general
  R&D.. have you ever heard of the Heimlich Counter-Maneuver?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well,
  it's a fantastic maneuver to induce choking.\"\n\n\"Induce.. choking?\"\n\n\"Yes,
  yes, well, I guess you haven't heard of it.  How about the Take a Wish Foundation?
  We take wishes away from sick children who won't be able to enjoy them, and pass
  them on to healthier children who will appreciate them more. \"\n\n\"Oh yeah!\",
  he went. \n\nHe looked around- our table was pretty empty. I panicked - \"Oh, we're
  just packing up right now- we've got everything all boxed up and we're ready to
  go.\"\n\nHer Evil Majesty deadpanned \"We had these awesome little plush companion
  cubes to give away.\"\n\nWe then started to discuss what we were looking for in
  applicants. \n\n\"We're looking for flexible people\", I said.  \"You're expected
  to do a lot of traveling, and deal with some extremely adverse situations.\"\n\n\"What's
  the application process like?\", he asked.\n\nHer Evil Majesty had this one. \"VERY
  intensive.\" \n\nHe then talked a little about himself- he had a degree in Electrical
  Engineering at the University of Waterloo, and was just finishing his MBA at SFU.
  \ At this point, me and Her Evil Majesty exchanged a glance and started shooing
  him away in a sort of graceful manner.\n\n\"Oh. I suppose you're not what we're
  looking for right now- we're going for a lot of lower-level types- C, C++, that
  sort of thing. \"\n\nWe shook his hand without even taking his name.  He asked for
  a brochure, but we explained that we had already packed all of the brochures away
  and were, in fact, just getting ready to leave. \n\nHe then took off. Me and Her
  Evil Majesty retreated to the common room, high-fived, and laughed and laughed and
  laughed, while telling the tale to everybody else in the room. \n\nMe, Her Evil
  Majesty, and Chris Demwell think we're going to set up a booth in the AQ next Friday.
  \ Are you in?"
