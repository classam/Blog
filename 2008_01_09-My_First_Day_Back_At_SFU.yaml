content: ! "I woke up at 7:20, to the harsh ring-tones of my cel-phone's built in
  alarm clock. The room I sleep in at Kristen's house has no windows, nor any real
  connection to the outside at all, so it was pitch dark. I suspected that I might
  be eaten by a grue, so I felt around for my glasses and staggered outside to hit
  the inconveniently located light-switch.\n\nA mere 4 hours of sleep was by no means
  enough, but at least I had 2 new blog posts- a Monday and a Tuesday- boxed up and
  ready.  While I hadn't gone out of my way to tell anybody about it, Monday was my
  'tutorial' day, and this time, I had written a tutorial about pasta sauce.\n\nHaving
  donned my excessively large watch, man-ring, necklace, and four-day-old clothing,
  I wandered upstairs.  I woke Kristen up just long enough to give her a kiss goodbye,
  and then came downstairs and started packing up to go.  Laptop? Check. Various cords?
  Check. Spare clothing? Check. A couple of scraps of paper and a pencil? Check.\n\nThe
  bus-trip to SFU from Kristen's place was seamless- a big difference from my daily
  Cloverdale-to-SFU exodus.  I actually arrived early, for once, and decided to check
  to see if the Common Room was open.\n\nThe Common Room is a little room located
  in-between the CS Labs and the Renaissance Mini-Coffee shop in the Applied Science
  building.  Managed by the Computing Science Student Society, the room has the cheapest
  pop and photocopies on campus, as well as a big group of cheap, oft-vandalized couches
  and usually a crowd of CS students occupying said couches.  The wave of recent vandalisms
  has forced the doors to close over the winter, so I wasn't sure if I had arrived
  too early on Monday to actually venture inside.\n\nIt was open- oh, and hey, Phil!
  We chatted a bit about the course we were about to take, Intro to Probability and
  Statistics, and went on a short quest for supplies. Then, to class!\n\nRobin Insley
  is an older fellow with wispy whitish hair- if you've been at SFU for any length
  of time, you have had at least three professors who look just like him.  Because
  STAT 270 is one of those low level math courses that everybody and his grandmother
  has to take, he had the usual math-teacher \"We will take no shit from you, these
  are the rules and regulations\" spiel to give out in class.  This was a 45-minute-long
  litany that I had already heard a thousand times before. I broke out my novel and
  read a chapter or so- <a title=\"Heat\" href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Heat-Adventures-Pasta-Maker-Apprentice-Dante-Quoting/dp/0385662572/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1199835750&sr=8-1\">at
  this point Bill Buford was still apprenticed to the Tuscan butcher, and hadn't returned
  to New York, yet</a>- and handily ignored the bulk of the lesson.  The only part
  that really stood out as 'important' was that Prof. Insley wanted a typed cover
  letter on any assignments.\n\nHaving maybe 10 minutes left to cover any actual information,
  we started on a quick overview of terminology.  Statistics estimate parameters.
  The mean of the sample estimates the mean of the population.  The standard deviation
  of the sample estimates the standard deviation of the population. Here are some
  greek letters. \n\nOkay, finally that's over.  Leave the course and SWEET MERCIFUL
  BAGUETTE WHAT THE HELL? The AQ was as busy as a fall afternoon and it's only 10:30
  in the morning! Elbowing my way through the crowd, I made it to the Common Room
  in one piece.  Ahh. Some people I know were there. I went with my standard greeting
  of holding my arms in the air and bellowing names. JEN! BENTON! \n\nSome socializing
  occurred. \"Are you in 376? -Everybody- is in 376.\"  There were way more new people
  than I remember seeing in the common room. Most of my friends are graduated or close,
  and the longer I spend at SFU the fewer familiar faces there are.\n\nI took the
  opportunity to out and nab a ham panini, some tomato bisque and a fruit salad at
  the Renaissance. $9. I noticed a new 'sandwich station' in the back, with a Subway-like
  menu at slightly higher prices. At some point, I'm going to have to try their meatball
  sub. \n\nThe panini is good- it's like someone took a ham sandwich and Italianed
  it up a smidge with some spices and grilling.  The tomato bisque was terrible.  The
  fruit salad was the usual huge chunks of cheap melon, spiced up with the occasional
  tiny bit of kiwi or strawberry for an excessive price. (About $4)  I bet I could
  make a better fruit salad at home, and cheaper, too!\n\nOkay, off to 376, \"Tech
  Writing and Group Dynamics\". This time, I'm with a roving parade of friends who
  I'm taking the course with.  Unlike the earlier STAT course, this is a higher level
  Computing Science course- which means both that the class is much smaller (me and
  my compatriots make up about a third of the class) and that we are in the tiniest,
  most obscure corner of the AQ that we can be fit in.\n\nThe professor, Ted Kirkpatrick,
  was not at all what I was expecting.  Jovial, skinny, balding, with a cardigan-sweater
  and pressed pants, he didn't actually seem like most of the CS professors I encounter
  at SFU.  He seemed a lot more like my English teacher from high school.  Ted was
  a campus favourite, one of the profs famous for delivering a solid course. I asked
  him for his autograph. \"I only sign pictures\", he responded.  A quick thinker-
  good.\n\nThe first 20 minutes of the course was... a writing exercise. I haven't
  done actual work in a lecture since grade 12!  Once again the high-school English
  teacher flashback hit me.  It was a free form, and faced with the tyranny of the
  blank page and no ideas I stared off into space a little bit.  Maybe I should go
  into one of my many tirades about how Powerpoint Lectures suck?  Nah.. a description
  of my day thus far? Too boring. Perhaps a couple of paragraphs about not having
  anything to write about? Not original enough. \n\nA-ha!  Inspiration struck me and
  I started laying the groundwork for the many excuses I planned to use for my lateness/absence/late-homework
  over the course of the semester.  I have many elderly grandparents and several rare
  diseases, I claimed.  My handwriting was messy, and unprofessional - I'm happy I'll
  be able to write anything further with a computer. \n\nThe rest of the lecture was
  a lecture in the traditional sense- some set-up for the course and maybe a smidge
  of lecture material.  Tech Writing and Group Dynamics is, it's made clear, the dumping
  point for a mishmash of things that the CS professors think should be taught to
  CS students- but not by *them*- and the bits that are too short to be courses on
  their own.  Prof. Kirkpatrick makes it clear that while that's the intention of
  this course, for all intensive purposes this is a technical writing course and the
  aim is to improve our collective ability to make words go on paper.\n\nWe also have
  to turn in a one-page written 'thing' every class, three times a week.  For me,
  being as I have a blog that I'm technically supposed to post in 5-times-per-week,
  I can just discard two posts that are too long, off-topic, or polemic and hand in
  the rest. Great.\n\nWe dispersed.  On the way back to the Common Room, I saw Steve-
  \"Hi, Steve!\" I said- and then \"Bye, Steve!\" as I kept walking towards the Common
  Room.  I was a bit too smelly and tired to want to have a conversation with him
  at the time.  In fact, the thought of a nice nap was beginning to seem like the
  best possible thing I could do. (Four hours of sleep, remember.)\n\nI returned to
  the common room and nabbed a spot on the couch, not really talking or doing much
  for the next hour.  A little bit of spacing is always good for the soul. \n\nThe
  next course was CMPT 384, \"Symbolic Computing\".  Now, in my head, 'symbolic computing'
  is synonymous with 'functional programming', but the first little bit of the course
  made it clear that that was not (in fact) what I was learning.  Symbolic computing
  is (however) closely tied to functional programming in that symbolic computing is
  best expressed through functional programs.\n\nThe classroom was located in what
  could only be described as the University's basement. The ceiling was low, there
  were lots of tubes and vents, no windows. The room was very small and warm and painted
  in the sort of bright beige that institutions use when they no longer care what
  you think about them. \n\nHere's the problem- Tony Dixon is a good professor. He
  delivers a clear, on-topic lecture that's well organized.  Somehow, however, some
  combination of his monotonic voice, slow presentation, and the dry content of the
  lectures actually knock me unconscious.  My notes for 384 are significantly uglier
  than those for Stats or Tech Writing because while Dixon was talking I would actually
  fall asleep *while writing*.\n\nI hoped that it was the warm room and the lack of
  sleep that did it to me- the last time I took a Dixon course I was taking 2 math
  courses and chronically low on sleep anyways, and I assume I'll be able to perform
  more efficiently this year.  If I can't stay awake through his next few lectures,
  I'm going to have to switch 384 with 383- an almost-equivalent course with Frank
  Burton - Who, while verifiably insane, is at least a respectable lecturer.  Instead
  of getting to program in glorious Lisp, however, I'd be using Prolog. \n\nI staggered
  sleepily out of the class when it was done.  I stopped at the Triple O's, thinking
  a burger would be a nice way to finish my day, but eventually took off when I noticed
  that the line wasn't moving at all and the person working the till at the front
  seemed to be having a chat with another employee while a third person stood in the
  back and looked confused.  Such efficiency!\n\nOn the way back to class, I encountered
  <a title=\"Monkeyitus\" href=\"http://nofoolscomics.com/\">Dylan Innes</a>, co-cartoonist,
  film-major and generally funny man. Time for the arms-up signature greeting. DYLAN!
  \ He was walking about with his brother, and the three of us went to the SFU pub
  for a beer and some nachos.\n\nApparently, the SFU Pub has recently raised prices
  again, in some sort of clearly business-savvy attempt to keep from ever making any
  money.  Dylan sprung for some $12 nachos, and I bought a $15 pitcher of beer (on
  special!).  Drinking and talking ensued- he wants to start really building a community
  of cartoonists around his website, and he wants me to.. well, make that possible
  with his website.  Maybe if I have time in-between all of my other stuff...\n\nWe
  then ventured to the bus-system and I bussed home. I was working on a nice buzz
  with the half-pitcher of beer I drank, (I'm a lightweight, so what!) and very tired.
  \ I finally arrived home, let our new puppy Maya out for a pee, and went upstairs
  for a much needed shower and change of clothes, followed by a nap which ended up
  lasting about 12 hours."
