content: ! "So, the <a href=\"http://mother3.fobby.net/\">fan-translation of Mother
  3</a> (\"Earthbound 2: Finally More Earthbound, You Bastards\") is finally complete.
  \n\nThe game took 12 years to actually finish in Japan, and they (apparently) figured
  that nobody in North America was still interested.\n\nWhich, honestly, if it weren't
  for the fan translation project, I wouldn't be. I mean, Earthbound was a great game-
  very clever, original, and full of great characters.  The ability to *pop* underpowered
  monsters like overfull balloons was a welcome addition to any RPG.  On the other
  hand, it was a *monolithic* grind.  I'm really not a fan of having to work -that-
  hard to beat a game. "
