  home a barbequed chicken, a package of chicken gravy, and some tomatoes.  \n\nWhen
  I arrived home, I set upon the barbequed chicken with a knife, separating it into
  it's constituent parts.  It's really very easy- the chicken just pulls apart.  While
  I was working on that, I had the gravy on the stove.\n\nIt all came together- toast,
  some mayonnaise, slices of tomato, some pepper, chicken, shredded cheese, and gravy,
  all together, formed a sandwich that was quite possibly the perfect embodiment of
  the sandwich Tao.  The Alpha and the Omega.  The One True Sandwich.\n\nI still have
  some chicken in the fridge, and some gravy, just waiting to once-again form the
  cornerstone of an earth-shaking sandwich."
