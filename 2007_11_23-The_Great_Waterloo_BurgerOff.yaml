content: ! "Just a few days ago, I thought I'd perform a test to determine the best
  burger in the vicinity of my office.  \n\nI set out to the University Plaza, and
  duly purchased a Chill n' Grill 'Big Juicy Burger', an iced-tea beverage, a Harvey's
  'Angus Burger', and some onion rings.  I thought I'd also toss the Kelsey's \"Peppercorn
  burger\" that I had a while ago into the ring. \n\nHere are the results:\n\n<strong>
  The Harvey's Angus Burger </strong>\n\n<strong> Layout: </strong> \nOne Harvey's
  Angus burger with bacon and cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, mayonnaise, mustard,
  ketchup, and barbeque sauce. Onion rings.\n\n<strong> The Bun: </strong>\nAn impregnable
  glutenous mass- a fairly generic burger bun, solid and ready to hold up it's side
  of the burger bargain- but very dense.\n\n<strong> The Meat: </strong>\nRubbery
  and flavourless. A very bland offering, patty-wise.  Probably the worst of the lot.\n\n<strong>
  The Toppins: </strong>\nThey put everything on my burger that I asked for.  No problems
  here, a good selection of toppings.  The bacon was (like the meat) a little flavourless.
  Ah, well. \n\n<strong> The Side: </strong>\nDelicious, delicious onion rings.  Crispy,
  oniony, all-in-all a good offering.\n\n<strong> The Price: </strong>\nWithout the
  rings? Just under $6.00 for the burger. \n\n<strong> The Chill N' Grill 'Big Juicy'
  Burger. </strong>\n\n<strong> Layout: </strong> \nOne BJ burger with cheese, lettuce,
  fried mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, and barbeque sauce.
  One cheap canned beverage. (They're only like 40 cents on top of the price of the
  burger.)\n\n<strong> The Bun: </strong>\nA soft, wishy-washy offering.  The bun
  is quite possibly the worst part of the Chill N' Grill layout.  They take a soft,
  crusty roll and try to toast it to harden it a bit. It makes for a good eat-in burger,
  but if this bun travels more than 10 feet it's going to soak up the burger juices
  and fall apart. \n\n<strong> The Meat: </strong>\nA smidge burned, but good stuff.
  \ The burger was a bit charred, but still meaty and juicy. While probably the thinnest
  burger of the bunch, it takes the 'not sucking' cake.\n\n<strong> The Toppins: </strong>\nOn
  top of my normal burger-deck of toppings, I managed to get some fried mushrooms.
  Fried mushrooms on a burger are <em>delicious</em>. Other options included fried
  onions, which are also delicious. High marks for the cool options! \n\n<strong>
  The Side: </strong>\nWhile it was nice getting a cheapo can of pop with the meal,
  I've had Chill N' Grill fries before.  So have you, probably, if you've ever eaten
  at a Fish And Chips sort of eatery- for about $2.50, you get a big greasy basket
  full of thick, fried potato chunks. While it may win for it's economy value, I've
  never been a fan of those big chunky fries and tend to avoid them whenever possible.\n\n<strong>
  The Price: </strong>\nBurger and drink for about $6.00\n\n\n<strong> The Kelsey's
  Peppercorn Burger </strong>\n\n<strong> Layout: </strong> \nApparently a 'signature'
  Kelsey's burger.  A largeish patty with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayonnaise.
  \ A small Caesar salad and an iced-tea on the side.\n\n<strong> The Bun: </strong>\nHey,
  restaurants have the bun thing down pat- A pretty standard 'restaurant burger bun',
  but it holds the burger together better than the Chill and Grill, without being
  as comically dense as the Harvey's offering.\n\n<strong> The Meat: </strong>\nFairly
  juicy, and covered in cracked peppercorns.  When it comes down to it, the excessive
  pepperiness of the meat really overpowers the flavor of the meat and the rest of
  the burger.  Okay, but not great.\n\n<strong> The Toppins: </strong>\nDisappointing
  at best.  Restaurant burgers never really offer the full plethora of cool burger
  options unless you want to pay out the nose for all of the extras. Who wants to
  pay another buck-fifty for bacon or mushrooms? \n\n<strong> The Side: </strong>\nBoo!
  The Caesar salad was dry and tasteless. Barely worthy of the name 'Caesar salad',
  it was more a slab of romaine with some Parmesan cheese sprinkled over it. \n\n<strong>
  The Price: </strong>\nClearly the loser, here.  The burger, salad, and drink, plus
  tax and tip, came to about $16.00.\n\n\n<strong> THE WINNER: </strong>\nThe local
  Chill n' Grill wins for having the best meat, the most local flava', the best toppings,
  and the best price of the lot. Not to mention, supporting the local guys is always
  a cool option. "
