content: ! "You all remember that I bought a MacBook, right? \n\nSo, I find myself
  doing web development, and wondering how to do all of the Linuxy stuff I love without
  abandoning this Macintosh paradigm that I've grown to enjoy so much in the past
  few weeks.\n\nSome people- bearded, angry people- might suggest that all platforms
  are equivalently useful for web development, but I'm a big fan of convenience- and
  the ability to apt-get things I want is just too useful.  Dependency-management
  by hand is for <a href=\"http://www.slackbook.org/html/package-management.html\">schmucks</a>
  and Windows users. \n\nFortunately, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/40826399@N00/2511695101/in/photostream/\">IRC
  </a> came to the rescue once again, and suggested <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSHFS\">sshfs</a>.
  \ Investigations proved fruitful.\n\n<h3> Virtual Machines </h3>\n\nI'm using VMWare
  Fusion to run Ubuntu 8.04 Server Edition within the Macbook.\n\nVMWare Fusion makes
  it almost painfully easy to install an operating system within the Mac.  Download
  the <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu ISO</a>.  In VMWare Fusion, add a
  virtual machine, select 'Linux' and a few inconsequential configuration options.
  \n\nUbuntu 64bit or 32bit both work fine.  VMWare Fusion can handle either.  \n\nWhen
  prompted for the CD, instead \"Browse\" for the Ubuntu ISO that you originally downloaded.\n\nThen
  you just run through the standard Ubuntu installation. No problem. \n\n<h3>Install
  SSH</h3>\n\nThe Server edition of Ubuntu comes with SSH already installed.  Should
  you find yourself without it (maybe you're using the Desktop edition?), just run
  <code>sudo apt-get install openssh-server</code> and <code>sudo apt-get install
  openssh-client</code>.  Everything will configure-itself for you. \n\nAt some point,
  you might need the local IP of your Ubuntu server- <code>ifconfig</code> will produce
  the information you're looking for. \n\n<h3> Install MacFUZE and MacFusion </h3>\n\nNow,
  we want to mount the virtual Ubuntu filesystem like it was a local filesystem within
  the Mac.  Install <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/\">MacFuse</a>, then
  <a href=\"http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/mgorbach/MacFusionWeb/\">MacFusion</a>.
  \ It's as easy to install as everything traditionally is on a Mac. (It has clicking
  AND dragging.)\n\nThe MacFusion program will appear in the toolbar.  Click on it,
  select 'easy mount', followed by 'SSH', and give it that IP address that you pulled
  out of your Macbuntu earlier.    \n\nThe name and password are the ones that you
  initialized the system with. Like magic, this will grant you access to your Ubuntu
  filesystem from within the Mac.  Glorious! But, of course, it's only good for file
  editing.  \n\n<h3>Use the power of SSH</h3>\n\nIf you don't already know how to
  use the Mac's built-in SSH functionality, shame on you.  Find and open the 'Terminal'
  program, and type in <code>SSH your_ip_address -l your_username</code> \n\nFiguring
  out what to do with the Ubuntu terminal is beyond the scope of this article- all
  you need to know is that every system administration task you need to perform can
  be done from the command line, and if you weren't such a dyed-in-the-wool noob,
  you'd be able to do text editing from within the command line too. (Don't worry-
  I prefer graphical text editors, too.)\n\n<h3> Install all of your favourite programs
  </h3>\n\nSo now, go forth and be fruitful!  Install all of your favourite Linux
  programs! <code>apt-get</code> is your friend. \n\nOkay, you're set- you've got
  a sweet development rig for the webternets. Rejoice!"
