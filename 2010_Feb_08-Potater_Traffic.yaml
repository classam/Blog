content: ! "I put up Google Analytics on Friday, and now I have Weekend Potater Data
  to look at. \n\nIt's pretty grim. 17 people, all weekend.  It would almost be more
  effective for me to hand-deliver the SIZZLIN' HOT POTATER CONTENT, perhaps via snail-mail.
  \n\nThe one saving grace is that 89% of the traffic is \"Direct\" - so the people
  who do come to the site know the name. <a href='http://potater.com'>potater.com</a>
  is just so darn memorable.  Good domain name. Potater potater potater. \n\nUnrelatedly,
  me and Kristen finally handed 9-7's ass to it, 3-coins-and-all. Take THAT, vile
  level.  Now it's just gathering the star coins in World 8 and one last Star Road
  level and we are done-and-done, entirely co-op. "
