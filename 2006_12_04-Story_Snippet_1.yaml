content: ! 'James regained consciousness in a waiting room.


  It was the type of waiting room you''d find in an department store or a government
  office. The floors were yellowed linoleum, the chairs were uncomfortable, and there
  was a Pepsi clock from the early 80''s sitting on the wall next to a pop-machine
  that clearly had not been operational for some time.  Cheap, grainy music was being
  piped in through a single speaker on the wall, and the room had a definite sense
  of purgatory about it.


  Aside from James, the room contained a pair of doors.  One door, a solid wooden
  number with a smoked glass window proudly proclaimed in block-type letters that
  it contained one Mr. Halvard, Resettlement Clerk Grade 4.  The other door was a
  similarly wooden type, but with no glass or markings on it.  Sitting above the second
  door was the always-familiar glowing "Exit" sign that, while ubiquitous, handily
  suggested a function for the door.

  James took a quick peek outside the "Exit" door, and immediately regretted having
  done so.  The view was simply an endless gray plane touching at a faraway horizon.


  Having no appetite for nothingness, James tried the other door- and found it locked.  Puzzled,
  and bored, he sat down on a hard plastic chair and started leafing through a Time
  magazine that had clearly been sitting around for some time.


  It wasn''t until just then that he recognized the music playing softly in the background-
  Sympathy for the Devil by the Rolling Stones.


  James wasn''t sure if it was grim foreshadowing, an interesting coincidence, or
  a joke at his expense.'
