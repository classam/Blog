  however, I am an Officer in the Regular Forces of the Canadian Forces so I am quite
  surprised with the number of inaccuracies in the letter and the prank that one would
  fall for it.\n</blockquote>\n\nWell, Josh, if you were the subject of a prank, I
  wouldn't knowingly <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=403\">choose something
  like the Canadian Forces</a> - I'd pick something that you were unfamiliar with.
  \ The amount you're able to get away with, vis-a-vis subterfuge, is pretty evenly
  balanced against how much *you* know about that thing, and how much someone else
  knows about that same thing.  In the same way, I wouldn't try to fool Phil about,
  say, Reggae, nor would I try to play a Slackware-themed prank on Travis.  \n\nWhat
  I know about the Canadian Forces? Almost nothing.  Hierarchical authority gives
  me the raging angries, anyways.  But I know more about it (after 5 minutes of Internet
  research) than my parents do, so I can pull it off. \n\nWhat do I know about Uzbekistan?
  Almost nothing. But I created a fake Uzbek driver's license (for poops and giggles)
  on the general theory that NOBODY in my circle of friends has any idea what an Uzbekistan
  driver's license looks like.  Neither do I, but as long as nobody who's actually
  seen the real thing comes along, it's a perfectly convincing looking license. (Okay,
  maybe the name's a little silly, but aside from that...) \n\n<img src=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/images/Uzbek.jpg\"
  alt=\"Uzbekistan Driver's License\" />\n\nTo conclude- if you're weaving a web of
  lies, there's always someone who can untangle said web. You probably shouldn't get
  yourself in that position anyways.  On the other hand, when you're setting up an
  elaborate joke, as long as your target knows less about the subject than you do,
  all you need is detail- the sort of detail that you can unveil by spending maybe
  a couple of minutes on Google. Nobody's going to go much further than that to learn
  about the subject anyways."
