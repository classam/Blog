  Greetings, society-member!


  Hold on to your monocle and opium-pipe, fellow high-society-types..  I

  have a rather surprising development to talk about: the monumental

  semesterly Computing Science Student Society Local Area

  Networkable-style party! (Or "LAN Party" as our bourgeoisie so

  colloquially put it.)


  Yes, we will have computers, games, snacks, and all of that fun paraphernalia!


  Now, if you''re a regular at these LAN parties, you might have noticed

  something shocking- something odd- perhaps even something a bit

  unnerving. Nobody seems to bring their computer anymore- and our

  Local-Area-Network has been growing smaller, and smaller, and smaller.

  (And once more: smaller.)


  (If you''re not a regular, don''t worry... we still love you.)


  Oh my! Whatever could we do to combat the growing gentrification of

  our LAN party?

  Idea! Let''s give it a shot at the new Surrey campus- where they have

  powerful computers just lolligagging about! After some small

  negotiation with "The Surrey", we''ve managed a solution.


  On FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 9TH, starting at 7:00ISH PM, we have reserved a

  computer lab in Surrey (3150) - a computer lab that will be

  pre-stocked with AWESOME MULTIPLAYER GAMES!- the only thing we have to

  do is sit down and start kicking one-another''s asses!

  We have also booked a nearby room for the distribution of DELICIOUS

  FREE FOODS! and the playing of ENTERTAINING NON-COMPUTER-STYLE GAMES!.


  Here''s the rub. In order to get Surrey''s ACS (Admittedly several times

  more awesome than Burnaby''s ACS for letting us do this) to do all of

  the laborious busywork of setting up the computers with awesome games,

  we need to provide them with entertaining open-source games - and by

  this Friday! Gasp!


  Yes, I''m calling upon you, BRAVE, HARDWORKING CS STUDENTS (and brave,

  hardworking students of other assorted non-CS faculties who I also

  respect: you''re invited too) to do the society a GREAT SERVICE and...

  PLAY GAMES!


  We need you to sift through a big list of free, open-source games- and

  tell us which ones you want to play at the LAN party.


  This CSSS forum topic contains a good starting point for fun & free:

  (Thanks to Dan Leslie for pretty much compiling the whole thing)

  and this 1up article contains another group of fun, free games for the playing:

  And by no means be restricted by these lists- if you know of other

  good free fun stuff, I can lump ''em in, too.


  I need your submissions in by FRIDAY MORNING ( Feb 2 ) , so that I can

  download them, bundle them all up in a DVD or two with Licensing

  information, and ship ''em off to ACS @ Surrey.


  Do it! Do it for the good of the society! Play games! Play them

  quickly! Play them now! And tell me which ones you want to play (and

  where I can find them) !


  Go!
