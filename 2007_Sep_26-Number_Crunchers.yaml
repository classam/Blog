  />\n\nI just recently received an e-mail from my boss's boss.  He seems like a nice
  guy- he talks about his kids a lot, which seems like a calculated (and successful)
  attempt to make him seem more human. \n\nThe e-mail was taking a bi-weekly meeting
  that didn't really accomplish much, and turning it into a short monthly meeting
  with a definite purpose. Bravo! \n\nThis, however, was in the e-mail:\n\n\"Using
  David Yachâ€™s theory for counting efficiencies, this move will reflect a 2% efficiency
  improvement in the next quarter for STS. \"\n\nNow, David Yach is the VP of Software
  at RIM, so this one line managed to convey both 'ass-kissing' and 'bean-counting',
  two qualities that give me the serious jeebies. "
