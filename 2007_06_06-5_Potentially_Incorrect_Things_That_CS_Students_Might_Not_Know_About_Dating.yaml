  />\n<strong>\n1. Shave.</strong>\n\nYou know those sexy guys with just a little
  bit of stubble that you see on T.V.?\nYeah, you're not one of those guys. A lot
  of careful work and skill goes into the \nmaintenance of the 'rugged but not unkempt'
  look.\nBy wearing unmaintained facial hair, you send the following message to women:\n\"I
  no longer care about my appearance or the prospect of ever dating.\"\n\nShould you
  want to experiment with the dangerous world of facial hair, here are some quick\nguidelines:\n\n<strong>1</strong>)
  Trace your jawline from ear to chin to ear. No hair should ever grow below this
  point.\n<strong>2</strong>) Check consistency- is your facial hair patchy in places?
  Yeah, shave it.\n<strong>3</strong>) Is your facial hair a beard? Beards are very
  prevalent in Computing Science. No.\n<strong>4</strong>) Do you look terrible with
  facial hair? You're not allowed to make this call yourself:  Ask a competent female
  friend. \n\n<strong>2. Don't poach WICS</strong>\n\nWomen in Computing Science are
  an exceedingly rare breed.  Chances are, they're taken, and even barring that, they
  have the potential to be exceedingly choosy: Behind you are three more guys lookin'
  for a girl who understands CS.\nNot saying that finding a girlfriend who can match
  your skills in CS is impossible, just that you shouldn't bank on it - You had better
  be a mighty sexy contender if you want to compete in this arena.\n\n<strong>\n3.
  Talk</strong>\n\nConversation is a difficult fish to fry.  Chances are, if you're
  in CS, you have a difficult time having conversations with the 'normies'. What do
  you talk about? They glaze over whenever you talk about Ubuntu and the beauty of
  apt-get. They space-camp whenever you start to wander into the topic of cryptology.\n\nAha!
  Here's the problem- you're talking too much.  People love talking about themselves.
  I love talking about *MY*self. Hell, that's why I have a blog! So if you're in a
  conversation.. give other people opportunities to talk about themselves. \n\n\"So,
  how are you finding the course so far?\" \"Oh really? You don't like Mr. Weathermayer?
  What professors do you like?\" \n\nDo you know how to stop a conversation dead-in-it's-tracks?
  Make a declarative statement and don't follow up with a question.\n\n\"I like cheetos.\"\n\nNow,
  of course, just asking an endless litany of questions is bound to make you out to
  be quite the creepy fellow.. so toss in some information about yourself or a comment
  when you're asking the questions.\n\n\"Oh, that sounds terrible. Something like
  that happened to me once- I had a professor who couldn't tell his ass from a hole
  in the ground. I have no idea how people like that get jobs. So, what are you in
  for, anyways?  Cognitive Science? \"\n\nIf you want to, think of a conversation
  like a game where it's your goal to get the other person to talk as much as possible
  while remaining moderately quiet yourself.\n\n<strong>4. Meet new people\n</strong>\nOkay,
  so, chances are you hang out with a pretty static group of friends. All of the women
  you know are either dating someone or clearly not interested in you. What now, huh?\nIt's
  time to join some clubs and activities!\nYou don't necessarily need to forge a whole
  new group of friends- but find some clubs around campus that you're interested and
  spend time with people you've never met before.  University is basically a 4-year-long
  license to meet scodes of new people.\nAnd if you meet someone attractive in one
  of these clubs, by all means strike up a conversation: If it ends up being really
  awkward, you've maybe lost 15 minutes of your time to a person you'll never see
  again.\n\n<strong>5. The \"Friend\" zone is not a happy place.\n</strong>\nI've
  been in the \"Friend\" zone. Nobody wants to be there. It's a terrible place. \nOf
  course, if you actually just want to be friends, the \"Friend\" zone is an awesome
  place- but if you're wanting to start a relationship, it's a zone of constant, painful
  torture. Don't be that guy. \nIf you're swooning over a friend- make a move. Ask
  them on a date- make sure you use the word 'date'- if you hang out normally and
  say 'let's get some coffee', you're really not saying anything.\nIf you're feeling
  especially ribald, go for a kiss!\n\nAnd.. what now? This is the 'super awkward'
  zone.  She really just likes you as a friend, she never thought of you that way,
  and she'd rather not 'go there'. Okay, now you can stop torturing yourself, distance
  yourself from her for a few months, and try to meet some new female friends. Torture
  over. \n\nAlternatively, things <em>could</em> go well (don't get your hopes up)
  and you could be out of the friend zone and into the relationship zone. At this
  point, don't get unnecessarily giddy or creepy. Take things slowly. A relationship
  is very different from a friendship, and dealing with the new dynamic is going to
  take a while.\n"
