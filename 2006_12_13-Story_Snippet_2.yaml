  Mr. Halvard had delivered this speech hundreds of times, and it went a little differently
  each time.  It didn''t discourage the whole process from becoming very boring. He
  was angling, however, for that comfortable little private nook to spend a few millenia
  in. Finding someone to design and engineer that would be quite expensive, so Mr.
  Halvard was filling the boring but necessary function of Resettlement Clerk.


  "You''re dead."


  In a dry tone, James responded. "So I''ve gathered."


  Halvard hated the smug ones. "Oh, and how did you come by that little gem of wisdom?"


  "Well, my last lucid memory is of the grille of a Mack truck. Now I''m in a waiting
  room with a door that seems to lead into nowhere. I can''t imagine this is a hospital.
  "


  "Hmm.. Well, you seem to have grasped your situation nicely. I''ll get your paperwork
  and we''ll try to get you through the process as quickly as possible. "


  Mr. Halvard walked over to a filing cabinet that was sitting in the sparsely attired
  office.  The dingy institutional atmosphere was specifically designed to calm people
  down, keep them from getting too emotional or overstimulated by the whole experience.  The
  music was Halvard''s own touch- he really enjoyed the Stones, and eagerly awaited
  their death so that he could see them live. The filing cabinet sat next to a desk
  made out of some cheap substitute for wood.


  The file wasn''t very difficult to find.Â  James'' file was sitting alone in the
  file cabinet. Mr. Halvard plucked it out and flipped through it. He also grabbed
  a small, leatherbound guidebook sitting next to it.


  "James Laurent... born 1984, died 2005 from an unexpected collision with a Mack
  Truck. The Mack Truck came out of it fine, although the bill for getting it cleaned
  was probably nightmarish.  Large family.  Budding career in software development.
  Atheist. Shockingly good shape for a dead software developer."


  Halvard looked up from the file for a moment, and snidely commented, "the leading
  cause of death amongst software developers is donuts, coffee, cigarettes, and deadlines."
  He then poked back into the file. "Promising grades, single...etcetera, etcetera.
  "


  The resettlement officer stood up a little straighter, and delivered what seemed
  to James to be a pretty standard spiel. "Okay, welcome to the afterlife.  You''ve
  been assigned a block of infinite free space to do whatever you want with.  You
  can start building a universe right away, if you want, but it''s tough.  You can
  spend a few millenia apprenticing with an existing developer or studying at a university
  to learn the ropes of world creation, or you can get a job and pay someone to do
  it for you. "


  Halvard stopped to take a breath, but before James could cram in a question he started
  again.


  "You probably have a lot of questions about your religion of choice, the afterlife,
  rules and regulations therein, and your current existance in general. Many people
  do, and therefore we''ve prepared a guidebook for you. Here is your copy."


  Mr. Halvard handed James a thin leatherbound volume with no clear title and continued
  once more. "For any further instructions, please refer to the book, which is a quite
  capable source of information. Please exit the way you came in. "


  Mr. Halvard then pointed towards his door. It was open. James squeaked out an unsure,
  "So, I just... go? "

  "Yes. It should all be in the guidebook, and I don''t have all day to answer your
  questions. I have an appointment with a busload of orphan children that just crashed
  into a second busload of nuns. It''s going to be a busy day. " Mr. Halvard sighed
  sarcastically. He really didn''t have any more appointments today, but he could
  really go for a early lunch today, and who would notice?


  James walked out of the building, into the gray nothingness.


  Halvard decided that he would have a smoked ham panini with a moroccan curry soup.
  Mmm.'
