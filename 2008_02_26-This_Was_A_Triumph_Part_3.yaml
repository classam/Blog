  to be Aperture Science at SFU's OpFair</a>, and then we printed up some sexy <a
  href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/projects/ascience/\">Aperture Science Leaflets</a>
  in full gloss, with business cards.\n\n<img src=\"http://gallery.daybinge.org/d/192-2/flyers.jpg\"
  alt=\"Aperture Science\" /> Just last Wednesday, it was once again time for SFU
  to host a career fair- this time for all of the students, instead of just the technical
  types.  I put on a suit, <a href=\"http://blag.daybinge.org/?p=14\">Her Evil Majesty</a>
  put on some nice duds, and Chris Demwell came in a leather jacket, looking very
  software developery. \n\nWe worked out a list of things that we could talk about.
  \ I would cover the basic canon- The history of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture_Science#Aperture_Science_Laboratories\">Aperture
  Science</a>, our big <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/glados/\">Operating
  System project</a>, the Take a Wish foundation, the Heimlich Counter-Maneuver, and
  the man-sized ad-hoc quantum tunnel through physical space with possible applications
  as a shower curtain.  I would also discuss such interesting topics as our constant
  need for temps in the \"QA\" department, our fast-paced, travel-oriented workload,
  and our benifits package (We're the only company in Seattle to offer full life insurance!)
  .\n\nHer Evil Majesty would provide valuable support and professionalism.\n\nChris
  would affect a heavy Russian accent and talk about software development, occasionally
  dropping the accent accidentally when he got excited or irritated. \n\nWe decided
  that if we started to run out of material, Chris and I could bicker about whether
  or not \"Web Development\" counts as real software development. \n\nSo, we wandered
  around the career fair a bit- and, wait-look! One of the booths is packing up early.
  \ Everybody stand nearby and look busy. Don't look directly at them. Are they gone?
  They're gone.  Quickly- steal the table!\n\nWe nabbed the table, put down Chris's
  heavy metallic briefcase, our flyers, and our business cards really quickly. Having
  set-up, we started sitting down and smiling at people.  \n\nGreg and Her Evil Majesty
  took pictures, available <a href=\"http://gregbaker.ca/gallery2/2008/aperture/\">here</a>
  and <a href=\"http://gallery.daybinge.org/v/Science/\">here</a>. \n\nThe only sad
  thing about the ruse was that- most University students don't seem interested in
  these booths.  We pretty much ignore the people in these booths year-round.  \n\nAh,
  well, when OpFair comes around next, we'll be ready- with supplies, a smooth sales
  pitch, glossy, Aperture Science leaflets, and maybe even a projector! "
