  Or Not For Websites\" href=\"http://commandshift3.com/\">CommandShift3</a>. \n\nIf
  you're a <a title=\"Reddit\" href=\"http://reddit.com/\">redditor</a>, you've probably
  already seen this.  CommandShift3 is like a Hot Or Not for websites- you submit
  your website title, it takes a picture, and your website is run against others in
  a series of one-on-one preference tests.  \n\nI thought I'd toss in this site and
  <a href=\"http://www.chownow.ca\">chownow.ca</a> for good measure, to see how my
  design skills stack up.  It came in about as I'd expected- not great, but better
  than absolutely abysmal.  I like to think that I'm improving over time- chownow.ca
  is more attractive than this site, and my next site (theoryBox.net when it goes
  up) will be even more attractive still.  Or not.\n\nOh, as a bonus- my site looks
  much uglier in Safari and Internet Explorer.  I can chalk that one up to laziness-
  whenever faced with a strange IE display bug, it was just easier to make the offending
  element disappear (no search for you, Internet Explorers!). \n\nThing is, I don't
  want to take the easy way out and just toss lots of gloss, sans-serif, rounded corners,
  and drop shadows on my site.  It's like decorating your house with stainless steel
  and dark woods - it's popular now because it's faddish, and it looks pretty good
  even if you don't know anything about design, but it just seems like a lazy solution.
  \ Great designs are the ones that do <a title=\"Allen Pike\" href=\"http://www.antipode.ca/\">strange
  things</a> but still end up being visually balanced, well-laid-out and interesting.\n\nOn
  a side note, CommandShift3 is clearly doing the \"Agile Web Company\" thing, as
  evidenced by the fact that the site's either exhibited bugs or broken bits at least
  five times since I stumbled upon it."
