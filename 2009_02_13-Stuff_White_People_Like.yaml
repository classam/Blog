content: ! "I have to say- I read one blog-post of \"Stuff White-People Like\" a long
  while ago, and dismissed it as silly and borderline racist - well, hey, I read the
  'asian girlfriends' post, devoid of any context.  He called UBC the \"University
  of a Billion Chinese\" (I happen to know it's 25,000, tops. )   What am I supposed
  to think?\n\nHowever, I just went through the rest of the content, and the whole
  thing is actually startlingly funny and <strong> absolutely horrifying </strong>
  because not only *am* I the guy described on the site (to a certain extent), so
  are a lot of my friends.  I'm not the irritating Vegan guy, but I am the irritating
  \"I don't have a TV\" guy, and I know the irritating Vegan guy.  In fact, being
  up at SFU all the time, I am exposed to the people described in this blog, a lot.
  Everybody in the entire Political Science department, for example. Also, every single
  person on Reddit. \n\nThe site should come with a warning label.  \"Do not read
  all at once. May damage brain.\""
