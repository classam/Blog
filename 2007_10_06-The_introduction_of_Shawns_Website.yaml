  Shawn''s started his own blog. It''s <a href="http://www.jansepar.com/">here</a>.  Much
  of it is an extra-snazzy pre-built template with lots of candy-coating... I really
  have to learn to add visual flair like that to some of the stuff I do. (I tend to
  veer towards simpler designs with few images, and a much heavier reliance on text
  & css- which leads them to look blocky.)


  Go team Shawn!'
