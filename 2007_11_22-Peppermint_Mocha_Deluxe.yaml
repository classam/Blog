content: ! "One of my co-workers has turned me on to a whole new world of beverage
  deliciousness. \n\nHe said, \"Drop a peppermint teabag into a hot chocolate. It's
  good!\"\n\nSo, I tried it, and it was delicious.\n\nWe have a free hot-chocolate/coffee
  machine at work, which makes average-ish hot chocolate and acceptable coffee.  I
  took my mug and filled it with a concoction of 50% hot chocolate, 50% coffee, 2
  creamers and a peppermint tea bag, then let it sit a little while.  What ensued
  was a delicious, chocolatey, minty, caffeiney beverage almost worthy of being a
  $5 Starbucks Concoction. \n\nOkay, we've settled on a new morning beverage, we have."
