content: ! "Inspired by <a href=\"http://travisbrown.ca/blog.html#InformationOrganization2009-11-10\">Travis's
  response</a> to some of <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=930\">my</a> and
  <a href=\"http://www.antipode.ca/2009/primary-sources/\">Allen's</a> ideas on the
  concept of information overload... I've decided to compile a top-ten of The Best
  Stuff That Happened In RSS Today. \n\n<blockquote>\nTravis Brown: In fact, I'd probably
  pay somebody to provide me a list of the twenty most important articles from yesterday.
  \n</blockquote>\n\nPerhaps I will make some money from Travis! Probably not. Let's
  see how this goes. \n\n\n<h3> Number 10: Gravity Ruler </h3>\nThis <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/01/carry-on-flying-gravity-ruler-weighs-checked-luggage/\">cool
  device for measuring luggage on the fly</a> would be neat to see in production.\n\n<h3>
  Number 9: Unladen Follow 2</h3> \nAllen's up to no good, and you can use his tool
  to learn <a href=\"http://www.antipode.ca/2010/unladen-follow-2-how-annoying-would-this-user-be/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+antipode+%28Antipode%29&utm_content=Google+Reader\">exactly
  how annoying your friends really are</a>. \n\n<h3> Number 8: Nedroid wakes up repeatedly</h3>\n<a
  href=\"http://nedroid.com/2010/01/no-more-parties/\">Mariachi Bird</a> should have
  his own TV show. I would watch it. \n\n<h3> Number 7: XKCD cheats at high-school
  robotics</h3>\n<a href=\"http://xkcd.com/689/\">XKCD</a> thinks of a novel way to
  win at robot soccer. \n\n<h3> Number 6: Daring Fireball Eulogizes the Newton </h3>
  \n<a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/the_original_tablet\">John Gruber</a>
  is not a villain from Die Hard. That is Hans Gruber.  Mr. Not-The-Villain talks
  about the failure of the Newton. \n\n<h3> Number 5: Dilbert on Focus Groups </h3>\n<a
  href=\"http://www.dilbert.com/fast/2010-01-14/\">They don't like us. </a>\n\n<h3>
  Number 4: What Comes After HTML 5? </h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.webmonkey.com/blog/What_Comes_After_HTML5__Just_HTML\">
  Scott Gilbertson</a> talks about what's next after HTML 5. As it turns out, it's
  not HTML 6! \n\n<h3> Number 3: The Price of Sexual Silence: $7.50 </h3>\n<a href=\"http://carnalnation.com/content/45040/719/price-sexual-silence\">Lilith</a>
  talks about how her deaf students, in a wealthy, conservative area of the United
  States, have received sexual education so insufficient that they don't even know
  HOW BABBY IS FORMED.  \n\n<h3> Number 2: Hark, A Vagrant </h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=239\">Do
  you remember Thundercats?</a>\n\n<h3> Number 1: First Person Tetris. </h3> \n<a
  href=\"http://www.firstpersontetris.com/\">First Person Tetris</a> - This dizzying
  version of tetris plays best in 'Night Mode' with the music on.  It's a reminder
  of how addictive Tetris really is, with a mind-bending twist.  Let me warn you,
  though, the <a href=\"http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1924722\">Tetris God is
  a CRUEL and ANGRY god</a>. "
