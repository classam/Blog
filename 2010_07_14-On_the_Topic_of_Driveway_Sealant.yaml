  Good afternoon, the internet.  I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of driveways
  and justice, have just discovered an ad in the local newspaper for "Airport Grade
  Driveway Sealant."


  Now, as a man who enjoys both driving, parking, and appying sealant to things, this
  would seem like an almost unquestionable boon.  Soon my driveway can be sealed in
  exactly the manner that the professionals seal.  The seal on my driveway could be
  world class!


  It was then, however, that the awful ambiguity inherent in the term "Airport Grade"
  started to sink into my skin like a sunscreen made of doubt.  Few if any would be
  interested in purchasing "Airport Grade" beef, or "Airport Grade" uncomfortable
  plastic chairs.


  In fact, I don''t even know if airports enjoy an improved driveway sealant experience.  I''m
  sure that they probably purchase a lot of driveway sealant, considering the amount
  of driveway they might have to seal, but people like me, we don''t necessarily prefer
  bulk-rate driveway sealants.  No, when I seal, I seal with an organic driveway sealant
  that I''ve sourced from a local driveway sealant merchant.  Sometimes I get my driveway
  sealant at a farmer''s market, fresh from the driveway sealant factory.  It''s that
  personal touch that takes my driveway to the next level.
