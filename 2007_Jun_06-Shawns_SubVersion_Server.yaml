  />\n\nSo, Shawn was wondering how to set up a SubVersion server...\n\nHere's what
  you do.\n\n1. Take an old computer. Not a complete heap, but it certainly doesn't
  need to be capable of mindblowing feats of graphical awesomeness.\n\n2. Go to <a
  href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">www.ubuntu.com</a>. Download 7.04, the Feisty Fawn.
  \n\n3. Install Ubuntu on your heap.  While you're at it, you can toss a hard drive
  or two in said heap and use it as a nifty file-server or music-server (My Ubuntu
  box is a combination of file-server, music-server, and internet-access-when-my-laptop-is-in-my-bag-and-I'm-too-lazy-to-boot-it-up)\nHaving
  lots of memory also plays well with SubVersion, which usually ends up holding a
  lot of code.\n\n(3.5: Learn how to use the command line. Honestly, it's an important
  skill. Not entirely necessary for what I'm describing here, but still important)\n\n4.
  Connect your heap to the internet. I'm assuming you know the basics of home networking,
  so I'm not going to motorboat your balls over this one.\n\n5. Look for online tutorials
  on how to set up SubVersion on Ubuntu. Chances are, this'll involve something really
  simple like 'sudo apt-get install subversion'. \n\n6. Do the same for ssh. If you
  have a SSH client running on your computer, you can login from far-far away and
  manage the heap- as well, you can use Filezilla's SFTP to access your files with
  a convenient FTP interface. \n\n7. Go to no-ip.com and hook yourself up with a dynamic
  DNS service. (Note: You can run the DNS update software on *any computer in the
  same network as your SubVersion server* and it will work fine. )\n\n8. In your router
  settings, make sure to forward the Subversion and SSH ports to the IP of your server.
  If your router is nice-a, you can get it to always give the same IP to the same
  MAC address (the MAC address of your server). \n\n9. You're pretty much ready. You
  have a SubVersion server- now you just need to RTFM and set up a repository.\n\n10.
  Notice that the performance isn't great if you're not in the same house as the server.
  The upload bandwidth of your standard home connection is pretty limited- this isn't
  great for media files by any means.\n\nThis is the hardest way to do things. Of
  course, it's free, and a learning experience you probably won't regret.\nGiven that,
  if you're looking to set up a SubVersion server much, much faster, get a <a href=\"http://http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?216909
  \">DreamHost account</a>.\n\nFor $10 a month, (paid a year at a time, pretty much)
  \ you get 150Gb of space (dropped from an earlier 200Gb), a free domain registration
  ('jansepar.com', for example) and 1.5 Tb of monthly bandwidth. They're currently
  running a *ridiculous* offer whereby if you use the promo code 555, you can get
  $50 off, 500Gb of space, 5Tb of bandwidth, and 5 free domain registrations: Try
  to hop on that one while it's still available: Good deal.\n\nIf that doesn't work,
  enter the promo-code SAUSAGEMEAT and you'll get $20.00 off, courtesy of me. (And
  you'll be helping this blog stay afloat. Woo. )\n\nKeep in mind that filling 200Gb
  of webspace is nary impossible on a standard DSL line: You'd have to be uploading
  constantly for weeks.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?216909 \">Dreamhost</a>
  offers amazingly easy SubVersion repository setup, amazingly easy e-mail setup,
  and a tonne of other perks- at the cost of occasional slowness and downtime- and
  it's still a shared server, so there are lots of neat things you can't do. It's
  certainly not the /best/ solution, but if you want to set up a SubVersion repository
  quick, maybe carve out a little spot for yourself on the internet.. well, it's there
  for you.\n\n"
