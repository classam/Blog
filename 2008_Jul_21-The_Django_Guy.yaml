  of Django seems to pop up, it's not long before a Django Guy rushes to it's defense.
  \n\nNow, using Django more and more, I start to internalize it's idiosyncrasies
  and feel like everything is where it is for a reason, so I can see that a lot of
  the criticism is misplaced- but it's strange that there's always someone out there
  to point that out- some Django Avenger, ready to swoop down and defend his technology
  of choice against all complaints. \n\nSo, um... Hello, Django guy! .. er.. Keep
  on' truckin'! "
