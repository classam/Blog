content: ! "So, I've been working on a puzzle game in my spare time as an excuse to
  dick around with Python, Javascript, and MongoDB. \n\nI've finally reached the point
  where I have a working prototype.  I haven't applied any style, except for the absolute
  bare-bones minimum to make a usable product.  Heck, I don't even have the domain
  set up properly, yet. Darn slow registrar.\n\nIt's still in an unstable 'development'
  mode ( Thanks to the magic of hooks, when I 'git push' from anywhere, it reboots
  all the things. Try to get away with that on a production machine. ) - okay, okay,
  I've prefaced this enough.\n\n<a href=\"http://50.112.114.149/\" title=\"The Watchmaker's
