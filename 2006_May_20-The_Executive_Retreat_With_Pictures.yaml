content: ! 'So, on Friday.. uh.. last Friday. The Friday before the Friday that was
  yesterday.. I showed The Godfather, lost $20 of CSSS money by overpurchasing pizza
  (I learned my lesson, I promise!), and then embarked on a quest to Whistler.


  There was a bus, and magazines (I have a Nintendo Power magazine that&#39;s a good
  13-14 years old, and a similarly old Computer Strategy magazine. It has a preview
  for Dune 2! That&#39;s how old it is!)


  So, we arrived at Whistler.. quickly, forming &quot;Team Food&quot; and &quot;Team
  Alcohol&quot;. Unfortunately, everybody wanted to be on Team Alcohol.. so, everybody
  was on Team Alcohol.

  Go team hard liquor! That&#39;s Anto, there, our new Vice President of Organizationality
  .. which basically means that he is the Vice President- his job is to assist the
  President.

  This is what we so eloquently dubbed, &quot;The Beeramid&quot;.


  Being that me, Michele, Anto, and Tadashi were all n00bs, we had to wear the Inky,
  Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde costumes (The ghosts from Pac-Man).

  I went &quot;Clyde&quot;, but Jen, as President, decreed that I would be Pinky.

  Yep, I&#39;m nothin&#39; but sexy. So that&#39;s Tadashi, our treasurer, Me, our
  Vice-President of Activities, Marcel, our Vice President of Resources and Awesomeness,
  and Michele, our.. Treasurer. .. see, Tadashi&#39;s only an interim Treasurer, because
  Michelle (one L or 2?) is away this semester.


  So, we settled in, wandered through Whistler Village a bit, then came home and played
  a rousing round of the Chairman&#39;s Game.<img src="http://www.sfu.ca/~kkerr/curtis/Pictures/retreat/The_Chairman.jpg"

  Freshman rules, of course. Penalty? Drink.


  There was much drinking, and then going to bed. The next morning? A whole day of
  planning and boring meeting stuff. Also? Hot tubbing, and a bear! OMG, BEARS!

  (Which is what Noah said when he saw the bear)

  This is Jen, our new President, in her awesome communist hat.  Thanks for the hat,
  Noah.


  So, we went out pubbing. There was something on the menu called &#39;sex cheese&#39;,
  and they wouldn&#39;t tell us what it was. So we had to order it. Mmm, cheese and
  wine-sauce. Fried. So .. healthy.<img src="http://www.sfu.ca/~kkerr/curtis/Pictures/retreat/The_Sex_Cheese.jpg"

  Oh, and we were still wearing our ghost costumes.

  The captain was here.

  So, morning two, Marcel and Noah take on the task of finishing the milk.

  So, this is all of us, Jen, Travis, Yang, Marcel, Anto, Noah, Me, Alix, Eugene,
  Tadashi, Michelle, and Trevor.


  We came home early in the morning, after about 3 hours of sleep. I was tired. When
  I got home, there was a big mother&#39;s day celebration.

  So, that was the retreat, in not-a-lot-of words. Yay!'
