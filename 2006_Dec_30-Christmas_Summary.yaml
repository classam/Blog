content: ! 'Christmas Eve:

  Meet mom''s boyfriend''s Italian family.  Holy crap, people.  Small, loud, pleasant
  group. Massive seafood dinner. Come home, watch some TV, sleep on inflatable bed.


  Christmas:

  Recieve assorted goods and services. Dole out same. Swag includes:

  Shoes

  Gift Cards

  Monies

  Shirts/Sweaters

  A Fuzzy Blanket

  Invader Zim Box Set (w00t!)


  Breakfast with mom- Jonathan (younger brother) prepares. Scrambled eggs, garlic,
  bacon, cheese, chives, toast. Delicious.


  Midday with dad. Very nice sneakers don''t fit. Must get new pair. Crap.


  Night with dad''s girlfriend''s family.  Holy crap, people. I know them all pretty
  well, by now.  Recieve surprisingly generous gift from step-grandfather and step-grandmother
  (enough money to mostly buy a laptop).  They were the only people who recieved hand-made
  Christmas Card for this year (Personalized comics- they go over well each year).
  Fantastic Christmas meal: Turkey, stuffing, potatoes, corn, etc... (See: "Curtis''s
  Love Affair With Starch & Fat")


  Boxing Day:

  Wake up late. To Best Buy! Manage to use combination of general sexiness, dashing
  attitute and velour tights to secure place at end of line. Wait many minutes. Recieve
  laptop. $599+Tax, no extended warranty (fuck you, Best Buy.), 1.75Ghz Celeron M
  (ick) 512Mb RAM (ick) 100Gb HDD (yay) DVD-RW (yay). It''s not much, but it''s mine.
  Dead sexy, too.  There''s always RAM upgrades. One core is enough, anyways, dammit.
  It''s not like computers are for ''gaming''. (It''s all about the text-editing).


  After exploiting line-related connections to brandish new laptop in fate''s eye,
  (Like so: Brandish!) attempt to return poorly-fitting shoes. Fail. Note that Athlete''s
  World is a trendy hellhole: Promise self to purchase shoes from less jackassish
  distributor in future.


  Help Dad look at skis. (Looking at skis requires to people. One person to look,
  and the other person to stand nearby, also looking.)


  Later, meet Kristen. Exchange further gifts- She recieves little crystal mouse.
  Curtis recieves Calvin & Hobbes Complete, (Motto: "It''s a metric tonne of entertainment")
  Futurama Season 4, (Now have 1,3,4, and secret Season 8, recieved by blowing the
  magic warp-flute at the end of Season 4) and a framed picture of Christopher Robin,
  Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, and Tigger (Most of whom are in an overturned umbrella).


  Time spent with Kristen. Family friend helped with purchase and installation of
  computer: Curtis recieves $100, + P3-833Mhz w/ 256Mhz RAM & 19in CRT for services
  rendered (Curtis was going to attempt to turn down the $100 until he spent 3 hours
  trading files around, configuring, repairing, re-working, and etcetera). Other family
  friend needs entry-level computer. Will install Ubuntu on system, flip to other
  family friend (free-of-charge, of course), perhaps. "For internet, e-mail and word
  processing only. You can''t figure out how to do anything else."


  Busy time with Kristen. Much to do, much to do.'
