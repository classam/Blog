  3000 won''t have <code>reduce</code></a>, apparently.


  As well, they''re taking out <code>map</code> and <code>lambda</code> functions
  - not because they don''t expect people to use the features, but because they expect
  people to use the Python syntax for these things, and not the Lisp syntax- which
  makes sense, because as far as I''ve seen, Lisp syntax is always horrible.


  So, goodbye, map, reduce, and lambda functions.  We''ll be replacing you with inline
  functions, and <code>[<em>function</em> for <em>x</em> in <em>list</em>]</code>.'
