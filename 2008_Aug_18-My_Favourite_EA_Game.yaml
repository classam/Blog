content: ! "Working at EA, I often find myself wondering what my favourite game developed
  by Electronic Arts would be. \n\nNot a game developed by people who are now owned
  by Electronic Arts- that's a pretty big category, dominated by games like Baldur's
  Gate 2, Battlefield 1942, and SimCity 3000.\n\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/39/Mlhgenesis.JPG/256px-Mlhgenesis.JPG\"
  alt=\"Mutant League Hockey\" />\n\nNo, my favourite EA game.  I'm going to have
  to say that the pinnacle of Electronic Arts' sports development had to be Mutant
  League Hockey.  \n\nIt takes all of the fun of NHL '94, mixed with chainsaws. How
  could that not be the best thing ever? \n"
