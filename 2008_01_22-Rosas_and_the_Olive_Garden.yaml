content: ! "My mother's boyfriend, Vinny, is an Italian guy.  His name is Vinny, for
  Pete's sake. Now, while my mom's kinda vaguely half-Italian, her father had kind
  of had a falling out with his family and the Italianness never really shined through.
  \ As for me, I have about the same cultural heritage as, say, a pickle.\n\nNot Vinny,
  though.  He still speaks the Italian that floated around his house as a youth- albeit
  only with his mother and father. His parents are bilingual, but they still watch
  all of their television in Italian if they can.  If there's any way to put it, they're
  <acronym title=\"Note the capitalization.\">Very Italian</acronym>. \n\nI went to
  Vinny's parents' for dinner on Saturday evening.  I look forward to eating dinner
  with Vinny's family, because the food is delicious.  I didn't eat all day leading
  up to it- no, no, if an Italian mother is involved and you don't come prepared with
  your appetite, you might leave dead or at least in some sort of stupor. (Heck, even
  if you do come with your appetite this might happen.)\n\nThe first time I had been
  to Rosa's for dinner, I had been unaware of the concept of a dinner with more than
  one course. Oh, you know, I was familiar with the concept in a nebulous 'yeah, maybe
  in a fancy restaurant' fashion, but it had never actually been applied to a meal
  that I'd eaten in more than a perfunctory appetizers-salad-meal-dessert sense.  So
  the first time I went, I had a big plate of pasta to start off with, a big saucy
  heap of noodles.  I was just finishing that, feeling just the right amount of full
  and happy when the family started suggesting that more food would be coming. I was
  flabbergasted- how could more food possibly exist? But no, there was more food,
  and I was expected to eat it. That was bad times right there.\n\nVinny's mother,
  Rosa, came out with a huge lasagna.  She started slicing it up and doling it out
  to people.  I had been prepared to eat a smaller, more appetizer-sized first dish
  when a plate of lasagna that could be described only as gargantuan appeared in front
  of me. It was a continent with cheese. \"Who do I pass this to?\" \"Oh, that's for
  you!\". Ah, well, I was consigned to a huge first course again. \n\nThe lasagna
  was simple and delicious.  Noodles, cheese, sauce, and shredded pork.  The tomato
  sauce was spectacular.\n\nAround the table there was a bottle of Pepsi and a huge
  old glass bottle of 7-up containing wine.  I made the mistake of having a little
  bit of that wine- perhaps the recycled container was insufficient warning.\n\nItalians
  don't dick about with wine.  Refined, light flavours are expensive, and if you're
  going to serve a lot of wine, you're going to want to look a little bit more towards
  economy.  This was a harsh, strong wine, a lot more like a punch to the cojones
  than the lighter wines that I'm used to drinking. Hoo, boy. \n\nHalfway through
  my lasagna, out came some bread and meatballs in sauce.  No butter or margarine
  for that bread- it's for soaking up sauce! I downed a few of the meatballs and soaked
  the bread in saucy goodness. This wasn't a soft bread, either- it was a hefty roll,
  something that could stand up to the saucy onslaught. \n\nI finished the lasagna,
  the meatballs, the bread, and the wine.  I felt like ringing a bell- Round One was
  done, I could retreat to my corner and catch my breath a little bit. Avoiding a
  second helping of lasagna took some emphatic hand waving at Rosa, though.  She's
  legendary for her ability to get people to eat.  One time, my mother was talking
  with Vinny, fork-in-hand, and Rosa whisked the fork out of mom's hand, stuck a cutlet
  on there, and put it back, all in one smooth motion.  \n\nThat certainly wasn't
  it, though.  It was time for the second course.  Out came breaded pork cutlets,
  breaded and fried zucchini slices, more meatballs, pickled peppers, a tomato-and-cucumber
  salad and a more traditional leafy-green salad- and not in small quantities, either.
  \ Vinny's father pointed at the salad and proudly exclaimed that it was from their
  own garden.  \n\nI happily loaded up a full plate.  Everything was delicious. \n\nAs
  my plate was finished, the process of clearing the table commenced- this wasn't
  actually clearing the table so much as Vinny was inspecting the various plates of
  food and trying to find takers.  \"Hey, Curtis, one more cutlet?\" \"How about you,
  John?\" \"Hailey? Another cutlet?\"\n\nOnce it was concluded that nobody could possibly
  eat any more, Rosa brought out a melon cut into very large wedges. Dessert! I downed
  a wedge- I'm not usually a melon fan, but it's nice after a big meal like that.\n\nAfter
  everybody had eaten a wedge or two... Rosa brought out more wedges. The other half
  of the melon needed to be eaten, too!\n\nAt this point, we've all been eating and
  talking for a couple of hours, now.  As a cap on the evening's meal, there was espresso
  and Rosa's home-made ladyfingers.  One dunked in the other makes for some serious
  awesomeness. \n\nThus concluded the meal.  I sat on the couch and finished off the
  rest of my 363 marking.\n\nSo, now we come to the other meal that I had just last
  night.  It was my dad's birthday, and we wanted to go somewhere nice- so out to
  the Olive Garden. \n\nThe Olive Garden is a bit of an anomaly- a new class of restaurant
  that's sprung up fairly recently- the higher-grade chain restaurant.  Despite the
  fact that Olive Garden is a enormous continent-spanning chain, somehow they manage
  to make every restaurant worthy of a star or two.  Somehow they've managed to find
  the elements that make a one or two-star restaurant successful and institutionalize
  them.\n\nThe place was ostensibly 'Italian', although after my Saturday experience,
  the whole place had a sort of Disneyland-veneer to it. \"This is what you think
  Italian restaurants are like\". \n\nThe service was quick and responsive.  Dad and
  Tracy tried a couple of wines and eventually ordered a nice <a title=\"XYZin\" href=\"http://xyzinwines.com/\">Zinfandel</a>.
  I had my trademark iced tea.  Off wine for a bit (remembering Saturday), I had a
  sip of wine and it was pleasant, layered, and light.  I was a bit perplexed that
  they had ordered wine before even deciding what to eat, but Dad and Tracy love their
  reds and it wouldn't have made much of a difference anyway. \n\nWe had an appetizer
  before dinner- deep fried zucchini and stuffed mushroom caps. Then, salad and bread
  sticks- the sticks fresh out of the oven, buttered and garlic salted.\n\nFor dinner,
  I had braised short-ribs with asiago-stuffed <acronym title=\"Tortelloni is the
  Italian way of saying 'Ravioli'\">tortelloni</acronym>. Dad had something-something-shrimp-something,
  and Tracy had a garlic-herb-grilled chicken with alfredo <acronym title=\"Little
  ears\"orecchiette</acronym>.\n\nMy meal was delicious- I had read Bill Buford's
  \"<a title=\"It's really good.\" href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Heat-Adventures-Pasta-Maker-Apprentice-Dante-Quoting/dp/0385662572/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=gateway&qid=1201077377&sr=8-1\">Heat</a>\"
  earlier, and I had been jonesing to try some braised short ribs.  The asiago tortelloni
  complemented it perfectly, and after cross-sampling, we all agreed that I had picked
  the best thing on the menu out of the three of us. \n\nWe finished up and went home.
  \n\nNow here's the thing that's bothering me- the Olive Garden had food that was
  every bit as delicious as Rosa's- but it just wasn't the same, not even close.  The
  Olive Garden chefs are precise and have managed to really get a handle on that fusion
  of French and Italian culinary technique that so defines the \"Italian\" food genre.
  \ There wasn't any sort of personality or genius to the food- I'm sure the recipe
  that I ate was the same thing that I could get at any Olive Garden across the country-
  but the execution of the mass-produced meal that I ate was perfect.\n\nThe Olive
  Garden meal was complex, well-orchestrated, precise, and soulless.  Rosa's meal
  was simple, traditional, and delicious. It was loud, and a Canucks game was playing
  the whole time in the background.\n\nOlive Garden has managed, it seems, to completely
  divorce Italian food from Italian culture.  Not that I don't think the meal was
  delicious- I'd recommend it to anyone.  I'm just a little nervous at calling it
  \"Italian\" food- it's really more \"Italian-themed\" food, like Canadianized Chinese
  food or the Tex-Mex we call Mexican. \n\nTo get the full experience, you really
  need to find a little old Italian mother in Vancouver. I'd give her four stars if
  I could. \n\nBon Appetit! "
