content: ! "Richard Dawkins' recent(ish) series, \"The Enemies of Reason\" takes jabs
  at both new-age sprituality and alternative medicine, even more firmly placing Richard
  Dawkins in the firm position in my list of Awesome Heroes (tm)- a list that includes...\n\n<ul>\n<li>
  Richard Dawkins- on account of saying everything I've ever thought about religion,
  spirituality, and other similarly made-up things... but in a far more developed
  and well-thought-out fashion. </li>\n<li> Greg Graffin - because once you're a famous
  punk rocker, a PhD,*and* a University lecturer- in science, no less, you've literally
  met and exceeded all expectations for awesomeness.</li> \n<li> SFU's Greg Mori,
  Greg Baker, and Brad Bart- for seeming to actually care about the craft and art
  of teaching- a rare enough commodity in Higher Education to render it nigh unexpected.
  </li> \n<li> Randall Monroe, and the Penny Arcade guys - for harnessing the awesome
  power of their comics to create geohashing, PAX, Child's Play, and ever-so-slightly
  increasing my bacon intake.</li>\n<li> Pizza Hut, for putting the cheese <strong>in</strong>
  the crust.  I know, guys, it was madness. But you tried. You tried so hard. </li>\n<li>
  Kent Hastings and Chris Archer, for <a href=\"http://drmcninja.com/page.php?pageNum=21&issue=13\">this</a>.</li>\n<li>
  Alan Moore, Neal Stephenson, Neil Gaiman, Douglas Adams, and then Douglas Adams
  again.  Because, you know.  Note that Alan Moore might be displaying early symptoms
  of the Stallman-Beard-Limit-Effect*. </li> \n<li> George Carlin, for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeSSwKffj9o\">this</a>.
  </li>\n<li> Kernighan, Ritchie, and Thompson, for introducing \"Hello World\", C,
  and Unix- and also for having awesome beards without suffering from the well-known
  Stallman-Beard-Limit-Effect*. </li>\n</ul>\n\n* Beard length is directly connected
  to both technical skill and antisocial tendencies.  Past a certain length, the antisocial
  tendencies start to take over- this is known as the Stallman-Beard-Limit-Effect. "
