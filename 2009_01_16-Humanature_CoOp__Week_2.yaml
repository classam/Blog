content: ! "My week has been a loop of:\n\n1. Read some header code.  \n\n2. Look
  at the underlying implementation, try to determine what’s going on.\n\n3. Discover
  some syntax of C++ that I don’t understand too well. \n\n4. Read about said feature
  in a few references (online or at my desk), or ask friends. (“Are C++ binary shift
  operators sensitive to endianness? No? OH! Now it makes sense!” )\n\n(Repeat 3-4
  a few times)\n\n5. Attempt to filter the new knowledge of the code into some sort
  of short, easily understandable summary that manages to be useful and non-obvious.
  \ (After some time reading the code for a rectangle class, I had an awful hard time
  thinking of anything other than “YYYup, that’s sure a rectangle. And all the stuff
  that you’d want to include with a rectangle. ”)\n\n6. Compile Doxygen\n\n7. Check
  Doxygen-generated page- be unsatisfied with the way the output came out (maybe the
  comments are in the wrong place or things could be grouped more attractively)\n\n8.
  Adjust comments, check Doxygen syntax.\n\n(Repeat 6-8 a few times)\n\n9. Get coffee.
  \n\nI like to think that I’m gradually spending less and less time in the 3-4 loop,
  but I’m still a tad slow and useless.\n"
