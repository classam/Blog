  />\n\nJust recently, Shawn posted <a title=\"Shawn's Blog\" href=\"http://www.jansepar.com/?p=7#comments\">this</a>
  on his blog. \n\nHere's an excerpt:\n\n<blockquote style=\"padding-left:10px; background-color:
  #EEEEE; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; border: 1px black solid;\">For those of you who
  know me, I pay close attention to American politics. Why? Because its interesting.
  Canadian politics is boring and unappealing to me, but I’m pretty sure that its
  because Canadian politics just works. Now, don’t take that as a statement that Socialism
  is better then Capitalism, because while that is up for debate, its certainly not
  what my point is. The simple fact of the matter is that America is no longer a Capitalist
  country, it is an Oligarchy.</blockquote>\n\nCanada is, at least as it stands, 'winning'.
  \ We're more secular, we have better access to health care and education, our dollar
  is kicking ass, and we still have most of our civil liberties.  \n\nOne of the reasons
  that Canada is so successful is because it's *not* a socialist country- nor is it
  entirely a *capitalist* country.  Countries that go too far down the socialist route
  have to deal with some pretty mad inefficiency and corruption, and that wonks up
  the economy.  French labour law, for example, makes the process of firing employees
  a horrible, harrowing experience for business owners. Sure, it's great for individual
  employees to have job security, but it also means that businesses are way less productive
  because there's less incentive not to be lazy.  There are lots of fun stories about
  how, in communist countries, some of the smartest and most driven people didn't
  work towards getting in to the high-pressure high-intelligence jobs, but instead
  aimed for the easiest jobs.\n\nThere are, however, fields where capitalism is just
  *too mean* for people to deal with.  If businesses had their way, they'd work their
  employees 18 hours a day for pennies. When capitalism goes *too far*, the middle
  class starts to dissolve, replaced by a large underclass and a tiny overclass.  This
  has a side effect of being <u>bad for the economy</u> .. because the biggest purchasers
  of goods and services are a healthy middle class.  It also tends to suck when everybody
  is poor. \n\nCanada strikes a balance- it regulates companies lightly, and maintains
  a strong middle class.  Welfare, health-care, taxes, everything, are programs to
  redistribute wealth in ways that narrow the gap between the lower classes and higher
  classes. This happens  in a very delicate manner, so that people don't feel the
  oppressive yoke of beaurocracy (too much) or the oppressive yoke of capitalism (too
  much). And the strong middle class that's developed builds a strong economy and
  ends up being pretty fair for everyone. Oh, everyone still has to deal with government
  crap and business crap, but they're in balance- and, as a bonus, everyone has access
  to a little bit of money and a little bit of health-care.  \n\nHow is it that Canada
  has managed to strike such a delicate balance for so long?  Canadians.  When we
  vote, we consider moral issues (yeah) but we also put a lot of thought into fiscal
  issues.  We don't want to push the economy too far towards robber-baron capitalism
  or bleeding-heart socialism, and so we largely end up voting for policies and politicians
  that keep the balance in check.  We like things the way they are. We want (generally)
  to vote in the centre - Liberal - and the only reason that the Conservatives won
  the last election was that they aped the Liberal stance wherever possible and tried
  to present themselves as \"Liberals, But Without The Corruption\".  People voted
  for them because they promised to maintain the status quo. \n\nOf course, the Canadian
  system is every bit as rife with the potential for corruption as the American system.
  \ Party politics are, by nature, not democratic.  Once a party is elected to power,
  they can start dissolving our rights, sending us on wild-goose-chase wars and generally
  jerking us around.  A true representative democracy would have each riding electing
  an independent candidate that reflects their own views and opinions. The thing is,
  though, a representative system designed with individual representation in mind
  ends up being optimized for party politics. People are lazy (they want to make simple
  decisions) and parties can dominate representative politics easily.  \n\nAt least,
  however, Canada still has political choice. You can go left, right, centre, or French.
  \ Each side's moral stance apes their financial stance- the right, champion of gung-ho
  'poor-people-suck' capitalism tend to embrace traditional 'gay-people-suck' style
  moral policies- which makes complete sense, because their constituencies tend to
  be composed of older, upper-class people who benefit from less financial restriction.
  The left, champion of 'hey, let's give poor people money' style politics tend to
  embrace the sort of idealistic moral politics most popular with their constituents-
  students (who are idealistic and have no money) and the lower class (who just have
  no money). The centre, with their tendency to win every election, ape the moral
  politics of middle class Canada - they're a little bit idealistic and a little bit
  practical.\n\nCanadian politics are boring because it's really easy to tell who
  you want to vote for.  The party who represents your interests the best are the
  NDP when you're young, poor, and idealistic, the Liberals when you're middle-aged,
  and the Conservatives when you're old, closed-minded and wealthy.  The strength
  of Canadian politics lies in the fact that - whether you're voting for morals or
  finances, you're voting for the right party - and this dulls the effect of 'issues'
  based politics.  The decision that Parliament comes to tends to echo what *most
  Canadians* think- gay marriage is okay, abortion is okay, we're still thinking about
  marijuana, don't execute people, maintain a polite-but-distant relation with our
  turbulent trading partner to the south, etcetera.\n\nCanadians also tend to watch
  out for violations of civil liberties.  We'll make a big stink about violations
  of privacy in the name of security, or political corruption, and we like our rights
  just the way they are (thank you).  By voting Conservative this last election (I
  would have preferred NDP, being a poor student, but whatevs') we've sent the message
  that *we do not tolerate political corruption*.\n\nThe Americans are in a totally
  different position. Their party system is all mixed up.  Their debates aren't over
  boring topics like fiscal policy or education- they argue about the *ISSUES*.  The
  elections revolve around hot-button topics like abortions, family-planning, and
  war.  And because of that, the party responsible for 'screw-poor-people' robber-baron
  capitalism is *wildly* overrepresented, and the middle class has been taking some
  serious hits all the while.  It's hard to even understand American politics- the
  whole thing is beyond insane and completely defies analysis. That's what makes it
  *interesting* to follow- it's broken, and totally unpredictable, and in charge of
  one of the most powerful countries in the planet. \n\nSo I follow Canadian and American
  politics.  Ours are boring, and I want them to stay that way because I *live* here.
  \ Maybe some day the Americans will get their shit in order and their politics will
  be boring, too. \n\n"
