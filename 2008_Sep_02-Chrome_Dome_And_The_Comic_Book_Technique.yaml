content: ! "Google Chrome is, so far, pretty amazing.\n\nIn case you don't know, Google
  Chrome is a new WebKit-based browser with mad-crazy Javascript speeds.  It has tight
  memory management, so it's not a candidate for the \"Firefox is now eating 800 Megs
  of system memory!\" problem.  \n\nIt takes the Firefox 'AwesomeBar' concept and
  rolls with it, paring the UI down to just a google-powered SuperAwesomeBar and slick
  tabs.  You don't know how many times I've wanted to drag a tab out of Firefox to
  make a new window.  Now I can! (Huttah!). \n\nGoogle Gears is (of course) built
  right in, and the whole project is (of course) open-source-free.\n\nIt's small,
  and blazingly lightweight/fast.  I have to say, I'm definitely in like with it.
  \n\nHere's the thing, though- I wouldn't know or care about all of Google Chrome's
  neat features if it weren't for the informative and highly sexified <a href=\"http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/#\">Google
  Chrome Comic Book</a>.  \"Hey, that looks a bit like Scott McCloud\", you might
  say- yes it is.  \n\nScott McCloud is currently one of the world's masters in the
  field of visual expository- I mean, he's one of maybe eight people in the field,
  but nevertheless he's damn good at making explanations concise, readable, and interesting.
  \ If he wrote a book on calculus, I might finally understand what the hell a complex
  number is. \n\nAnd the comic he wrote- well- it looks like it took a lot of work
  to make, but I hereby decree that I will take in *any* information presented in
  this fashion, and like it! "
