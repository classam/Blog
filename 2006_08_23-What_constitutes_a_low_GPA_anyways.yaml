  constitutes over half of a CS degree!


  It all goes so fast. Maybe some Co-Op will slow things down. Also? Money. I really
  don''t feel ready to leave university quite yet.. a little supplemental education
  in English, maybe some art and design...a little economics for the road... I''m
  dirt poor, but I''ve now reached the point where I can get a Co-Op job (I hope)
  and maybe pay for a little more University at a time. I''m sure my parents would
  be fine with my lazy ass hangin'' around a bit longer.


  Currently, my GPA is 2.74, a healthy B-.

  Is that dangerously low? I dunno, seems okay to me. And with over half of my degree
  done, nothing seems to be causing major fluctuations in it- I could probably swing
  a few D''s and C-''s without breaking my GPA much, although I can imagine such alarming
  marks might encourage more speculation in the brutally easy IAT courses, or maybe
  another History or Humanity.  Math courses lower my GPA, humanities raise my GPA,
  and my performance in CS courses has almost always been a "C+/B-" (Except in the
  first-year courses, but they don''t count because they were easy-breezy).


  So, in summary:

  Yay, third-year!

  Boo, low GPA!

  Yay, possible course-meandering!

  Boo, no money!

  Yay, Co-Op jobs!

  Boo, not getting any Co-Op jobs! (yet)'
