  on my ability to cram random objects I find around the house into my mouth. \n\nInstead,
  I thought to myself.. 'omelette'. So, I found the <a title=\"Good Eats S7E3P1: The
  Egg Files VI - French Flop\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ctOrOZ__p0&feature=related\">relevant
  episode</a> of the show. \n\nMy omelette had paprika, chili flakes, basil, cheese,
  and fresh tomato.  Before that, I took some leftover potatoes and fried them up
  with seasoning salt and black pepper. \n\n<img src=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/images/omelette.jpg\"

  more difficult than my more-frequent breakfast fare of 'poached eggs n' toast',
  which are roughly as easy as just showing up. Thank YOU, Alton Brown.  I'm going
  to have to do this more often."
