  finishing up the new home for these Top 10 Lists.  You can see a early non-functional
  design preview, <a href=\"http://potater.com/top10/\">here</a>, if you'd like. \n\n<h3>
  Number 10 - Dolor Sit Amet </h3>\n<a href=\"http://photoshopdisasters.blogspot.com/2010/01/globe-lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet.html\">Lorem
  ipsum! LOREM IPSUM! </a>\n\n<h3> Number 9 - Ok Go Ahead </h3>\nAfter the whole Ok
  Go buzz caused by their Open Letter two days ago, <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/01/ok-go-interview/\">Wired
  interviewed them</a>. The interview is solid and they include two new Ok Go music
  videos, which are clever if not overly catchy.\n\n<h3> Number 8 - The Growing Reality
  of Aquaculture </h3>\nA quick look at <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/01/22/the-growing-reality-of-aquaculture/\">fish
  farming.</a>  Can it be made sustainable? A few billion more hungry mouths on the
  planet are hoping so. \n\n<h3> Number 7 - Moderne Burger </h3>\nThis is from a series
  of articles on how to eat food from all around the world, without leaving Vancouver.
  \ Of course, the \"<a href=\"http://ethniceats.ca/2010/01/22/moderne-burger/\">Moderne
  Burger</a>\" is just food from ... well, here, so it's not really that ethnic. Nevertheless,
  the description and image left my mouth watering, and it's definitely on my list
  of places to hunt down. \n\n<h3> Number 6 - Slime Mold </h3>\nThis has been covered
  up and down and all-across-the-internet, last few days, but Wired has the best pictures.
  Some scientists discovered that slime mold can form fairly optimal paths between
  'food nodes', and that if they lay out a system that looks like Tokyo, they get
  optimal paths that <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/01/slime-mold-grows-network-just-like-tokyo-rail-system/\">look
  like the Tokyo rail system</a>. \n\n<h3> Number 5 - Gallager Codes </h3>\nBefore
  I read <a href=\"http://www.ddj.com/architect/222400256?cid=RSSfeed_DDJ_All\">this
  article</a>, I did not even know what a \"Shannon Limit\" was. (It's still a little
  fuzzy, I'll admit.)  \n\n<h3> Number 4 - 35 Beautiful E-Commerce Sites </h3>\nThere's
  no better way to improve your feel for good designs than to look at them.  <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/22/35-beautiful-and-effective-ecommerce-websites/\">Here
  are a whole bunch</a>. \n\n<h3> Number 3 - Blast From The Past </h3>\n60-years-ago
  today, the Tucker Car Corporation was acquitted of fraud.  The <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2010/01/0122preston-tucker-acquitted/\">story
  behind their failed car </a>is a good, solid read. So go solid-read it! \n\n<h3>
  Number 2 - SPY'S SAPPIN MUH MARTINI </h3>\nThe<a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2010/01/22/engineers-guide-to-drinks/\">
  Engineer's Guide To Drinks</a> - which has nothing to do with TF2 - is merely a
  handy chart showing blueprints for a wide variety of alcoholic beverages.\n\n<h3>
  Number 1 - The BoingBoing Guide To The 2010 Indie Games Student Showcase </h3>\nIt's
  a long name, but the content is <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2010/01/22/the-boing-boing-guid-1.html\">worth
  it</a>. This is the showcase from which Portal's predecessor, \"Narbacular Drop\"
  - and other, similarly unusual, clever, or just strange games have been born. (\"Bontago\",
  for example. )  Most of the games can even be played, right now. So get to it! It's
  the weekend! \n\n"
