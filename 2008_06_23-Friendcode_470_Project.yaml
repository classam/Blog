  ... oh god, did I just say 'social networking platform' in a non-ironic sense?  Kill
  me now.\n\n    Okay, let's try that again.  I've got a bunch of online identities-
  Wii Friendcodes, an Xbox Live Gamertag, a Steam ID, DS Friendcodes, the works.  It's
  getting hard to share these things with my friends- and the whole point of these
  things is sharing with friends.  Friendcode is a meta-service to organize, sort,
  and share online identities - concentrating primarily on video games.\n\n<h3>The
  Bits That Are Just Database Access or Even Basic HTML, But Are Still Cool:</h3>\n
  \n<ul>\n<li> Events <small>Civilization 4, Sunday, 9:30am to 5:30pm!</small></li>\n<li>
  Messaging <small>Hey! Curtis, you should play Civ4 with us!</small></li>\n<li> Massaging
  <small>mmm, that feels nice</small> </li>\n<li> Mooseaging <small>it tastes better
  if you smoke it a couple of days</small> </li>\n<li> Simple, step-by-step instructions
  on how to get your systems online and your online identities set up. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The
  Bits That Make It More Than Just Simple Database Access:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li> Facebook
  Integration </li>\n<li> Data pulled from a variety of online services using some
  provided API's and some good ole' fashioned screen-scraping. </li>\n<ul><li> So,
  for example, all of your Steam account data can be displayed on your page. </li></ul>\n<li>
  A couple of slick JSON-powered AJAXY features to improve responsiveness. </li>\n<ul>
  \n<li> Dynamic registration </li>\n<li> Dynamic messages </li>\n<li> Dynamic dynamics
  (that are dynamic) </li>\n<li> Dynamite </li>\n</ul>\n<li>Cleanly degrading Javascript
  elements providing: </li>\n<ul> \n<li>Integrated Help</li>\n<li> Flexible Layout
  </li>\n<li> Moosages </li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>So, How Are We Going To Do It? </h3>\n
  \   Using the <a href=\"http://www.djangoproject.com/\">Django</a> platform- a framework
  of useful tools to make Python web development slicker and sexier.\n\n<h3>And What's
  The Plan For Actually Building It? </h3>\n    We'll start by getting a minimally
  functional just-the-database-access-and-nothing-else site up and running- something
  we hope to have ready in about a month, month and a half. (We have to learn Django,
  most of us) and then add slick features at the rate of about 'one slick feature
  per-person per-week'.  This may cause a mild case of death in Sepand, but he's fairly
  disposable anyways.\n\nIt was unavoidable, really.\n"
