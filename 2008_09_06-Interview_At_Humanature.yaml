content: ! "Okay, so, I'm interviewing at <a href=\"http://www.humanaturestudio.com\">Humanature
  Studios</a> this coming Friday, for a co-op position. \n\nMy rather silly <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/portfolio/humanature_2008.pdf\">cover-letter-and-resume-package</a>
  was the key.  \n\nApparently, though, they're rather interested in my C++ skills.
  \ Now, I'm a sharp guy- I have a week to remember everything I've ever learned about
  C++ - but C++? After spending time with Python, and, heck, even C#, working in C++
  again might make me cry a little.\n\nHave you guys ever heard of this studio? This
  company?"
