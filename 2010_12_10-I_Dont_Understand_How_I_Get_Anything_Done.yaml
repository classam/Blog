content: ! "It seems like I have a new overarching life goal every 28 minutes.  I
  feel like all of my goals are attainable if I work towards them, I just never know
  which ones I should be working on.\n\n<strong>One</strong> minute, I want to be
  the author of a semi-successful comic strip.  It doesn't need to be huge, you know,
  I'd be happy with a readership in the 500-1000 range. It should run for long enough
  to fill a book.  It should have consistent characters that exhibit some growth.
  \ Then I could print the book.  That's on the  'bucket list'.\n\nThe <strong>second</strong>
  minute, I want to be coding.  Coding something interesting, fun, no pressure, just
  trying my best to make something good for the sake of making something good.  I
  built <a href=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/pierc/#home\">Lumberjack</a> like this
  - and you know, with the user input, and the multiple revisions, I produced something
  that I'm really pretty proud of.  If I had time to put more effort into Lumberjack,
  I would do the same thing that I've done for the past few revisions: Remove features
  that people don't use (I'm looking at you, tags), and polish the features that people
  do use (Search!).   \n\nHell, I love coding stuff like this.  If I found a way to
  make money doing it, I could leave my soul-crushing corporate job and never go back!
  \ Yes, just need to find a way to get people to pay me to make whatever the hell
  software I feel like... \n\nThe <strong>third</strong> minute, I want to teach.
  \ You know, it's fun to do stuff, but I've always felt a special affinity for explaining
  things to other people. Telling stories, drawing diagrams, I've always deeply loved
  teaching things to people. If the government were to buckle, declare Computing Science
  a teachable major (okay, it is, but all you can teach is <em>math</em>, not any
  actual CS - I'm talking full-on high-school programming and CS courses), I'd be
  in a high-school before you could say 'boo'. <small> Of course, it's best to teach
  things to people who care. A class full of teenagers, especially the sort of tired-eyed,
  preoccupied teenagers who fill seats in high school? Ugh. </small>  Of course, I
  could be a lecturer at a University, but that would require a Master's degree at
  least, and ... well...  that's next. \n\nThe <strong>fourth</strong> minute, I want
  to work on research, just for the sake of working on research. I want a Master's
  degree, I want to learn everything there is to learn about a narrow field in CS,
  like <em>machine learning</em>, <em>evolutionary optimization algorithms</em>, or
  <em>distributed systems</em>.  But then, nobody who has been involved in the process
  of getting a Master's degree has ever recommended it.  I could always learn about
  these things on my own, right? \n\nThe <strong>fifth</strong> minute, I want to
  learn about <em>machine learning</em>, <em>evolutionary optimization algorithms</em>,
  or <em>distributed systems</em> on my own time.  I download some things on the internet,
  maybe flip through some textbooks that I have... and I'm overwhelmed by how dry
  the material is. Sure, I can power my way through it, but it doesn't help that I'm
  terrified of math. I'm bad at statistical analysis, couldn't derivate my way out
  of a bag. Couldn't tell Bayes' Theorem from a Bagel.\n\nThe <strong>sixth</strong>
  minute, I think maybe I'll try to conquer my Math Thing.  That minute is never more
  than sixty real-world seconds long. \n\nThe <strong>seventh</strong> minute, I start
  to think about all of the beautiful science that I left behind to become a CS student.
  \ What about biology? Chemistry? I've always wanted to know more about how the human
  body works, more about quantum chemistry, more about nuclear power and Vanadium
  and biochemistry and fermentation and hydrocarbons. Science with bubbling beakers,
  with data gathering, with charts and graphs. Of course, I'd have to go back to university,
  and god knows I can't afford <em>that</em>.\n\nThe <strong>eighth</strong> minute,
  I just want to make a dent in all of the books I have on my shelf.  Look at them
  - fiction, non-fiction, coding, science, art, and I've read maybe half of them.
  Some of them I've abandoned because they're dry. Some of them just don't get read
  because I never seem to find time to read. \n\nThe <strong>ninth</strong> minute,
  I want to learn Mandarin Chinese for some reason.  None of my friends who speak
  it seem to be enriched by the ability at all. (Not going to lie, it just seems like
  a vector for their parents to yell at them.) Usually it only takes me a few minutes
  to come to my senses. I come to my senses just long enough to get to ...\n\nThe
  <strong>tenth</strong> minute, where I want to make a game.  Not a Big Serious Full-Budget
  3D game.  I like games that are simple, and fast, and social, and strategic, and
  two-dimensional. I want to iterate, I want to test on friends, I want to get my
  design on, or get my hack on, make something worthwhile. \n\nOh, but then we get
  to the <strong>eleventh</strong> minute, where all of a sudden I think about how
  I want to develop my career.  You know, learn some JSTL, or some Stripes, start
  fiddling with the frameworks that we use at work to get our code on.   Maybe improve
  them. Stand out from the pack.  Do a great job, get to a senior position before
  I'm thirty, make 100K a year, and shoot for retirement at 55.\n\nThat's all well
  and good, but while I'm learning about Java, I want to share what I'm learning with
  others.  I want to teach again.  <strong>Twelfth</strong> minute I find myself wanting
  to write a book. A textbook. Informational, lots of examples and diagrams. On some
  good programming-y topic. \n\nOf course, instead of doing a book, I could always
  look at doing a Scott McCloud style informational-graphic-novel.  There aren't enough
  books in that format, and the ones I've seen have been incredible. Yeah, I'd love
  to be able to draw like that, really polish my (<small>meagre</small>) art skills,
  put something great together.  Heck, I could even do a regular web comic.  Which
  takes me back to the first minute. \n\nSo, overwhelmed by the incredible number
  of things that I should be doing, and the stonkingly limited time that I have to
  actually work on these things, I end up... well, sleepy, because this wild jumping
  between desires has taken up most of my already short night. I have, ultimately,
  accomplished nothing.  \n\nHooray. "
