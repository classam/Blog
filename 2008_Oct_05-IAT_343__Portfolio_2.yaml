  assignment.  \n\nThose of you with eyes might notice that this is exactly the same
  thing that I submitted for my first IAT 343 assignment. Notably, the first assignment
  I prepared exceeded the requirements of the first assignment- and seemed like a
  candidate for the second assignment.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/projects/iat343/portfolio1/Lassam_Port01img02_thumb.jpg\"

  \n\nHowever, this week, instead of concentrating on the modeling of the various
  objects in the scene, let's concentrate on the texturing and lighting. \n\nThe book's
  material was prepared in Photoshop- the pages are a 'faded paper' texture with the
  words to Alice in Wonderland on a transparent layer on top of it.  The book's 'sides'
  are composed of the faded paper texture, again, but less bold, and with straight
  lines drawn down the centre. \n\nThe pencils explore the crazy possibilities of
  UV-mapping- namely, binding a Photoshop file to a UV map, then painting within the
  UV map.  As a strange note, between Photoshop and Maya, the UV map seemed to shrink-
  I eventually had to re-adjust the whole thing to make it look proper. \n\nThe table
  is a reflective Phong shader with a wood texture.  The wood-texture is then used
  (in black & white) as the bump-map for the shader.  I wasn't sure if this was going
  to work properly, but with the bump map, reflections off of the table have a convincing
  'wobble' to them. \n\nThe scene's light is tinted yellow to keep the scene warm
  & inviting.  The scene's lighting is composed of four lights-  There's one ambient
  light to keep the scene from being completely dark around the edges. There are two
  spot lights inside the lamp- one pointing down and one pointing up.  This produces
  the proper lamp-light-circles (one coming out of the top and one coming out of the
  bottom)- and then a bright point light inside the lamp to create a brighter feel
  for the whole scene, emanating from the lamp.  Note that the lamp's bulb is set
  to glow- which combined with the light, makes the lamp's reflection in the desk
  look snazzy.\n\nThe lamp's base is a simple anisotropic material with reflectivity
  set up a bit- in order to make it look a bit 'lampier'. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/projects/iat343/portfolio1/textures/\">Here</a>
  are the textures used to prepare the scene.\n"
