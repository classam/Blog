content: ! 'So, the Christmas season is upon us again.

  "NO! NO! It''s only November 20th! Please! God, no!"

  Yes, it''s once again time for you to open your wallets for your assorted family
  members, to spend in an orgy of seasonal largesse what you''ve saved in a year of
  financial tightwaddery.


  But there''s a good chance that there''s one person in your family who''s tough
  to buy for: You don''t understand his likes or dislikes, and you have no idea what
  to get him.


  You''ve got a nerd.


  Well, let''s see what I can do to help you choose a christmas gift for your nerd.

  The first thing you want to do is figure out how much money you''re willing to spend.
  Is this nerd an acquaintance? A family member? A significant other? Are you going
  to be spending a lot of money, here?


  <strong>Price Range 1: Inexpensive Nerd Shopping</strong>


  Okay- so you''re not looking to blow a great deal of money on your nerd. I have
  to say that I understand completely- Christmas is an expensive time.


  The first thing you''re going to want to put on your list is <strong>books</strong>-
  books are always a fantastic gift for the nerd in your life.  Here''s the thing,
  though- buying specific books for your nerd can be quite difficult.  Preparing a
  list of desirable books can be a  torturous ordeal, and then finding the books can
  be a pain in the butt. If you can get your nerd to browse a bookstore or two and
  present you with a list of ''most wanted'' books, you can surely find a few of them
  and it makes a nice, solid present.


  I''d recommend, though, a giftcard.  Tuck a <strong>Chapters gift card</strong>
  in a nice coffee mug with some chocolate milk powder and a nice bow, and you have
  a pretty snazzy gift.


  But now we''ve wandered into the area of gift cards.

  Gift cards are a powerful thing, indeed- They allow you to show some sort of knowledge
  of the person you''re buying for without the cold impersonality of cash.


  What kind of gift certificates to get, though? Well, there''s the aforementioned
  Chapters gift certificate, a perennial favourite.

  You can also, however, get a <strong>gift certificate for Amazon.com or Amazon.ca</strong>-
  online bookstores that carry a pretty extensive stock, as well as DVD''s, music,
  games, and much more. The only problem with Amazon is that it carries *so much*
  that the gift starts to feel like cold, hard cash again- the important difference
  being that with the Amazon gift card, you know that the money is going towards something
  ''neat''.


  <strong>iTunes gift certificates</strong>.  iTunes is probably one of the most comprehensive
  music libraries in the world, and if your nerd is an audiophile, he''s sure to appreciate
  an iTunes gift certificate.

  You might, however, want to feel out your nerd''s position on the topic of music
  pirating- if he''s comfortable (and experienced) with it, your iTunes gift may fall
  upon deaf ears.

  (Even music pirates can appreciate the depth of eclectic music that can be found
  on iTunes, though)

  ThinkGeek is a fantastic place for gift-certificates.


  Outside of the realm of books and gift-cards, you can always shop at these assorted
  stores- but chances are, if you''re an external acquaintance, you''re not going
  to know your nerd well enough to be able to pick up for him a book that will pique
  his interest.


  <strong>Thinkgeek.com, A Nerd-by-numbers.

  </strong>


  Does your nerd work in an office? Perhaps developing software?

  Get him a red Swingline Stapler.  For those of you out there who haven''t seen the
  movie "Office Space" (All three of you)<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/homeoffice/gear/61b7/"><img
  align="left" src="http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/front/my-stapler.jpg"
  /></a> , the red Swingline is a very important office tool.  If your nerd works
  in a cool workplace, he''ll get commented on his cool red stapler.  If your nerd
  secretly hates his job, he can always have his red Swingline as a everlasting symbol
  of that last little bit of dignity.


  After that, there''s always <strong>the Despair calendar</strong>.  Each day of
  the calendar has a pithy saying that will prove an uplifting message for the day.

  It''s hard to really get the message of the very cool Despair products over with
  a simple blog post- so go to <a href="http://www.curtis.lassam.net/www.despair.com">www.despair.com</a>
  and take a look.

  Don''t underestimate the simple power of the /dev/blanket, a warm, fuzzy blanket
  expressing itself in pure machine code. Neat.


  Of course, this is just a few products available from the neat vault of thinkgeek.com.
  I can recommend a few others, including...

  <span style="font-weight: bold">So what have we learned?

  <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-weight: bold">

  </span></span></span>When going for small gifts, things that have a lot of novelty
  value are good. If your nerd likes a specific thing (computers, chemistry, a certain
  television show), it''s always good to exploit that knowledge with a product that
  exploits esoteric knowledge about that item. (Your nerd likes computers? Get him
  a pillow that says something in binary. Chemistry? Get him a <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/homeoffice/gear/8a2f/">Periodic
  Table Shower Curtain</a>)

  Things that can allow your nerd to buy books, DVD''s or music are always good.


  <strong>Into the land of more expense: Gadgets- goods and bads.</strong>


  Oh, it looks like you''re buying your nerd something a little more expensive.

  First of all, when you''re going expensive, go gadget. (Go go gadget WATCH!)

  mp3 players, cool cel-phones, portable video players, even laptop computers are
  all the object of some pretty solid nerd lust.


  But WAIT! Chances are, if your nerd plans on owning something cool like that, he''ll
  have done the research himself already- he knows what it is that he wants, and what
  the pros and cons of that object are.


  Here''s an example. mp3 players.

  There are numerous types of mp3 player- you have to decide on size, capacity, features,
  and brand.

  You can choose between Creative Zen, Sony, Apple iPod, and ''Miscellaneous'' to
  <strong>buy</strong>. Once you choose a brand, you have to look at the different
  features- within the iPod line, there''s the iPod Shuffle, the iPod Nano, and the
  iPod Video.  Heck, it''s even hard for <strong>me</strong> to sort through them
  all. The new Shuffle offers the least space (1Gb, which is about 250 songs.) but
  is small enough to completely enclose within your hand- that''s really cool. It
  also offers a pretty stellar battery life- and for a light music user, it offers
  probably the best music experience around. <strong>An</strong> iPod Nano offers
  a greater capacity (4Gb, 1000 songs.) and some neat additional features (Pictures,
  a menu) at the expense of size, expense, and battery life.  The <strong>iPod Video</strong>
  offers the most staggering capacity of all- 30-80 Gigabytes- which translates into
  entire collections of songs (Everything the Rolling Stones have ever produced fits
  in less than .5 of a Gb, for example) and can also show videos. For people who like
  music or even big-commuters, the Video would be the way to go.


  And that''s just within the world of iPods. What if you want to wander into the
  realm of cel-phones with built-in mp3 capacity?


  Jeez, it''s all so very complicated, wouldn''t you say?


  What''s the point of this little tirade? Simple enough- if you''re going to get
  your nerd something big, ensure that you have an idea what kind of equipment he
  wants (by brand and model) before you go out purchasin'' things.  You don''t necessarily
  have to ruin the surprise- just ask your nerd what he thinks is the ''best'' mp3
  player (allude to wanting one yourself) and wait for the short lecture on the differing
  models and types, followed by what he thinks is personally the best of the series.


  <span style="font-weight: bold">I need more examples to help me choose for my nerd.

  </span>

  Well, (hint hint), I keep a fairly up-to-date list of the goodies that I want at
  <a href="http://whatdoescurtiswant.wordpress.com/">whatdoescurtiswant.wordpress.com</a>


  - and you''d be hard-pressed to find a nerd nerdier than I am.


  Happy Christmas Shoppin''!'
