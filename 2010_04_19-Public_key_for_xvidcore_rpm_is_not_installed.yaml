  CentOS- add the dag repository, yum install ffmpeg, easy peasy, and I ran into the
  following error: \n\n<pre> \nPublic key for xvidcore-1.2.2-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm is
  not installed\n</pre>\n\nAfter much searching, I found the solution - import the
  dag GPG key with the following command:\n\n<pre>\nsudo rpm --import http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/packages/RPM-GPG-KEY.dag.txt\n</pre>\n\nBam. "
