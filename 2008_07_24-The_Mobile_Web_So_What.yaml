content: ! "Yesterday, John Boxall of <a href=\"http://www.handimobility.ca/index.html\">Handi
  Mobility</a> delivered a presentation on the Mobile Web for our CMPT 470 class.
  \n\nI learned that the much-vaunted \"MyBus\" SMS-bus service for Translink was
  initially powered by screen-scraping- and, indeed, is *still* powered by screen-scraping.
  \ Not that there's anything wrong with that, just a tad surprised.\n\nJohn Boxall's
  a \"Ask Everybody A Question And Then Wait\" style presenter.  \n\n\"Does anybody
  here know where the error is?\"\n\n\"Can anybody tell me what you'd be looking at
  if YOU were a genius billionaire playboy web developer like me?\"\n\n\"Who put the
  bop in the bop-she-bop-she-bop?\"\n\n\"Who here has an iPhone?\"\n\nThe problem
  with questions like that isn't the question- it's the inevitable wait for someone
  to answer. Always remember- presentations are not two-way, no matter how much you
  want them to be.  \n\nWe then got a lot of sales mumbo-jumbo about how mobile web
  development is the waaave of the future.  \n\nIn our class of 30 people, only 3-4
  of us had ever used the mobile web on our phones.  Few of us had data plans, and
  I was proud to be one of the small group of people for whom 'text messaging' is
  not a thing that I do. \n\nTo be blunt, we're CS students.  We're largely a group
  of early adopters- and even <em>we</em> haven't really wandered into the wild-and-wooly
  world of mobile internet access. \n\nIt doesn't help that Canadian cel-phone companies
  don't seem to want you to *use* any of the functions your phone has- well, at least
  without paying some sort of <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=461\">exorbitant
  fee</a>. \n\nPhones with decent UI interfaces, 3g, and reasonable data plans are
  new.  Like, this-year new.  Most of us are still stuck on a three-year plan with
  a phone that's just marginally better than a sack of wet beets.  \n\nHell, I hate
  my phone (Note to everyone: <strong>Motorola = No</strong>. Make a note of it.)
  but I'm on a $30/month no-system-access-fee 3-year contract with early evenings-and-weekends,
  voice-mail, and caller-id, and unless I plan to start tossing some serious cash
  at my <a href=\"http://www.bell.ca/home/\">already-a-bunch-of-douchebags</a> cel-phone
  company, I'm certainly not going anywhere fast- and guess what? I'm here with most
  of the consumers.  The current mobile environment in Canada doesn't support speedy
  cel-phone changes.\n\nSomething about <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/consumers/market/files/services/cellphones/accessfee.html\">system
  access fees</a> make me angry, too.  There's just some mental block that goes 'I'm
  not falling for that', and I get totally unwilling to consider a contract. \n\nIf
  I wanted to upgrade to a phone-that-doesn't-suck-for-web-browsing and a data-plan
  with unlimited-but-slow mobile web access, I'd have to blow about $600 (on the phone)
  and then spend an extra $18/month on my data plan.  \n\nYou know what else I could
  do with that money?  That's right, astute readers- delicious sandwiches. \n\nThe
  iPhone got the ball rolling. The mobile web is coming. It's going to be big- just
  you wait.  Just not.. yet.  Just like dial-up internet wasn't good enough for ubiquitous
  internet access, the current mobile web environment (in Canada, at least) isn't
  robust enough to support a lot of good apps- and won't be until everybody's contract
  expires and smart-enough phones are their new replacements. "
