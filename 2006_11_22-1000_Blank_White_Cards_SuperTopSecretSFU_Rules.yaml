  No? Well, that''s okay, you can learn how to play in about 2 minutes.


  I''m not going to take credit for creating this game- I found the rules on Wikipedia
  when I was browsing about. (I was reading about Zork, which lead to an article on
  Double Fanucci, which lead to an article about Nomic, which led to an article about
  The Chairman''s Game, which led to an article about Morningwood Crescent, which
  led to an article about 1000 Blank White Cards.. or something along those lines)

  Now, 1000 blank white cards is a totally open-ended game where everybody creates
  their own rules on cards and plays a card game with them. Depending on the people
  involved, it can either denigrate into total silliness or become as hideously complicated/silly
  as the dreaded game of Nomic.


  So I thought I might generate a few of my own "house" rules - to emphasise playability,
  fun, and fairness and reduce some of the inherent problems I saw in the game. As
  a built in win condition, tokens. To prevent "Dan Wins" cards, a rule forbidding
  player-specific effects. A few other tweaks and toggles.

  Since then, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000_Blank_White_Cards">WikiPedia
  article</a> explaining 1000 Blank White Cards has significantly improved- to the
  point where it seems most of my ideas were also-thought-of by other players and
  added to the game. Although they still don''t have tokens! It also had a few new
  ideas for 1KBWC that I thought were fabulous- after re-reading the article, I intend
  to change the ''bad card'' rule from wadding the card up and throwing it at Dom
  to putting it in a box (Dubbed "The Suck Box") where future players can bask in
  the painful glory of the worst rules we''ve seen.


  So, here it is: <strong>1000 Blank White Cards, The SFU Comp-Sci Variant, Full Rules</strong>:


  First of all, you need a bunch of <strong>tokens</strong>. It doesn''t matter what
  they are- we''ve used go pieces, screws, even a deck of playing cards.  Anything
  works fine, as long as they''re easily transportable (I''ll point out that the push-pins
  probably weren''t the most responsible token choice)


  Then, you need <strong>blank index cards</strong>. Tonnes of them. Scodes of them.
  Boxes of them.

  Preferably all the same size- in fact, you should pick one cheap brand and just
  stick to that one.

  They''re a good $3.50 a pack at the SFU Bookstore, or a much-more-reasonable $.99/pack
  at Quad Books, handily located about 10 paces away on the second floor of the MBC.
  (Think "Right next to the unreasonably priced photocopiers. For reasonably priced
  photocopies, wander over to the CSSS Common Room.)


  Finally, you need <strong>lots of pens</strong>.  When we first played, I bought
  a bunch of coloured pens simply for the purpose of playing 1000 Blank White Cards,
  and it significantly added to the flavor of the game. (Then, later, a bunch of damn
  dirty Common Room kids stole them.)   Thicker pens are good for restricting the
  length of the rules, which helps prevent the writing of long, painful rules packed
  full of if-statements and clarifications.


  Okay, now that you''ve got a big pile of <strong>blank white cards, </strong>you
  need to start writing rules on them.

  Any rules you want. Just toss together a bunch of rules.  When we first started,
  I handed everybody a pile of cards, and told them to start generating rules, giving
  them a few guidelines to get started.

  These guidelines?


  1. Rules must specify whether they are <strong>instant</strong> or <strong>permanent.
  </strong>An instant card is a card that you play, and has a one-time effect. A permanent
  card stays in play forever- or at least until something makes it go away.  Jeremy
  complained that the ''instant'' or ''permanent'' status of a card is too restrictive-
  and we clarified that all cards probably fit neatly into either ''it stays in play''
  or ''it goes away''- and if they don''t, well, they can make up a new word (semi-permanent,
  super-instant, plasma) and define what that word means on the card.


  2. Cards may not specifically target certain people in game-affecting ways.  Just
  like the last rule, this one''s not hard-and-fast, but it can be called upon to
  stop "Curtis Wins Immediately" or "Yang Loses All Of His Tokens".


  3.  If creating cards for the first time, everybody has to kick in a few boring
  ol'' "You collect N tokens"  cards, just to ensure that people can (theoretically)
  amass enough tokens to win the game.


  4.  Cards typically have a pithy title. <strong>The Wrath of Bradley Bart</strong>,
  perhaps, or <strong>Safety Dance</strong>. (They don''t have to make sense.) If
  you feel artsy, it''s also nice to include a little drawering to spice things up.

  So, now that you''ve created all of these cards, it''s time for the game to begin.

  The base rules of the game are as follows.


  1. Every person starts with a certain number of cards and a certain number of tokens.
  At first, when the game had very few cards and most of them were about amassing
  tokens, we started with <strong>2</strong> cards and <strong>0</strong> tokens.
  Later on, when the deck became greater in size and more of the cards either depended
  on other people''s tokens or contributed nothing to play, we started with 3-5 cards
  and 3-5 tokens.  You can really make your own decision, here.

  2. Gameplay starts on the dealer''s left. Until altered by a card, a person <strong>must</strong>
  draw one card, and that same person <strong>must</strong> play one card on his turn.


  3. The game ends when one person has <strong>20+</strong> tokens- that player wins.


  4. At any time, a player can create a new card and add it to the bottom of the deck.


  5. Cards are allowed to alter any of the previous rules.


  6. If, during play (or out-of-play) everybody unanimously decides that a card sucks,
  the player gets to wad it up and throw it away, then draw a new card. If <strong>Dom</strong>
  is around, the player wadding the card up must toss it at his head.


  So, now you''re on your way.  Your deck will start small, but eventually it will
  grow large, and unwieldy, and you''ll lose all of your coloured markers and the
  game will start to get a bit stale.

  That''s when it''s time to buy some new index cards, some new coloured markers,
  maybe even some Official Tokens (tm), split the deck into two decks, and start anew
  with a half-sized deck.


  Which is what I''m going to do as soon as my reign as Vice President of Activities
  begins anew at the start of next semester at SFU.


  Happy Blank White Carding!'
