  of you who still check my blog, even after this good month of absence, might wonder-
  why is Curtis not posting things in his blog? Is he dead? Wasn't he going to Waterloo,
  or something?\n\nYes, I am, in fact, going to Waterloo, Ontario, for a RIM job.
  (<a title=\"Salad Toss\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tossed_salad\">boi-oi-oing</a>).
  Today is my birthday (<a title=\"Important Sept. 1 Happenings\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sept_1\">Sept
  1</a>) and tomorrow, I'm on a jet plane.  I have an apartment lined up, I'm rooming
  with 2 UofW students and <a title=\"Tim Chow\" href=\"http://timchow.com/\">Tim
  Chow</a>, who is an <a title=\"Curtis Bashes the IAT Degree\" href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=213\">IAT
  student</a> and apparently a younger brother of a friend of Noah's. (Hey, Google!
  Noah Adams eats babies!) \n\nMy bags are packed. I have business casual clothing,
  my three best pairs of jeans, my laptop computer, a box of Mac', and some of my
  family's easy-and-delicious <a title=\"My Wiki\" href=\"http://wiki.lassam.net/index.php?title=Recipes\">recipes</a>.
  \n\nI'm off to Research in Motion to do PHP development. Maybe I'll fiddle with
  the Blackberry a bit- they have a few <a title=\"Blackberry Developer Resources\"
  href=\"http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/resources/\">dev-kits</a> that I'm
  just itchin' to fiddle with.  I'll try to keep you all posted on the details of
  the new adventure.  \n\nI also plan to learn some cookin' and try to put together
  a decent fileserver for under $100 (after which I'll post the instructions on how
  to do those things on my blog.)\n\nBon Voyage, me!  See you all later!"
