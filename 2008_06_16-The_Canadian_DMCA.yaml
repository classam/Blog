content: ! "If you've been following the news- and I don't blame you if you haven't-
  you might have noticed a recent cafuffle about some Canadian DMCA-something-something.
  \n\nHere's a quick summary:  The Canadian government (the Conservatives, mostly)
  have just recently <em>introduced</em> a bill- a bill which poses as a \"let's fix
  Canadian Copyright law\" sort of bill.  Now, I'll admit- Canadian Copyright law
  is broken six ways from Sunday- it's even illegal to record TV shows on to a VHS
  tape- and this bill addresses some of those issues in a sort of backwards fashion.
  \ \n\nIt also, however, makes it illegal to contravent <acronym title=\"Digital
  Rights Management\">DRM</acronym>- with a fine of up to $20,000 dollars for doing
  so.  This makes it illegal to do any number of things- unlocking cel-phones, for
  example.  With DRM protected by law, a lot more companies are prone to introduce
  it in Canada. \n\nI'd like to briefly point out that <a title=\"iTunes's old DRM
  scheme\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairPlay#Restrictions\">We Do Not Want
  That</a>.   \n\nIt's a lot more complex than just that- I'm trying to hyper-summarize,
  here, so I don't get anything wrong.  if you're interested, 0the whole thing has
  been covered extensively by <a href=\"http://www.michaelgeist.ca/\">Micheal Geist</a>,
  who is informally representing the opposition to the new laws.  Even the <a href=\"http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/technology/story.html?id=ae997868-220b-4dae-bf4f-47f6fc96ce5e\">Vancouver
  Sun</a> covered the new bill last Friday. \n\nSo.. <a href=\"http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/2431/125/\">what
  can you do</a>?\n"
