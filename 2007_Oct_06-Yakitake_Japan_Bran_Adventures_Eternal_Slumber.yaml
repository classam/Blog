  alt=\"Yakitake Japan\" />\nSo, after work yesterday, I came home and watched <a
  href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakitate%21%21_Japan#Main_characters\">Yakitake
  Japan</a> (Freshly Baked!! Japanese Bread) for about 5 hours.  It's an anime that
  manages to mock the way similar anime shows can be very melodramatic - so the melodrama
  is always cranked up to 11, despite the fact that the entire show is about bread.
  \ There's a lot of clever Japanese wordplay, none of which is understood by people
  outside of Japan. (The explanatory subtitles are faster than the eye can reasonably
  track).  \n\nDinner was the extraordinarily healthy Macaroni & Cheese & Steamed
  Hot Dogs, followed by an All Bran bar later that night.\n\nAfter dinner and anime,
  there was about 3 hours of gastrointestinal distress, marked by nausea, upset stomach,
  and diarrhea.  Either something's up with those hot-dogs, I just plain ate too much,
  or my recent purchase of a box of All-Bran bars was a bad move. (Too much insoluble
  fiber in your system can cause irritation if introduced suddenly.. but the bars
  are surprisingly delicious!)\n\nThat kept me up until 4:30 in the morning, and I
  woke up 5 hours later with a nasty headache.  Then, I went back to sleep for.. oh,
  say, another 7 hours, and ended up waking up around 4:30 pm, still feeling kind
  of crappy but much better than usual. Exhaustion is a nasty thing.\n\nI'd like to
  go back to sleep, but that'll mess up my system and I should have a shower, go out,
  and do a bit of shopping before the holiday begins and EVERYTHING IN WATERLOO CLOSES.
  (No, really, on Labour Day, everything in Waterloo closed.)\n\nSome of my friends
  (who turned up in Waterloo of all places) have invited me to a Thanksgiving dinner.
  Hooray, Turkey after all!\n\n\n"
