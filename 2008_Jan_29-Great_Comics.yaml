content: ! "I am a big fan of webcomics- I think they're a unique art-form that really
  could only come about with the internet in place.  They're more personal, more shocking,
  more experimental, more adult, and more interesting than the sort of comics you'd
  get in your newspaper- and still pretty darn funny.\n\nSo, of course, over my travels,
  I'll occasionally encounter new and interesting webcomics that I'll add to my list
  and not tell anybody about. Some of my favourites are the ones that everybody knows
  about already - <a href=\"http://www.penny-arcade.com/\">Penny Arcade</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sinfest.net/\">Sinfest</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.somethingpositive.net/\">Something Positive</a>, <a href=\"http://www.smbc-comics.com/\">Saturday
  Morning Breakfast Cereal</a>, <a href=\"http://www.xkcd.com/\">xkcd</a>, <a href=\"http://www.drmcninja.com/\">Dr.
  McNinja</a>...\n\nBut the ones I'm going to talk about here are the classy ones
  that few people have heard of. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.samandfuzzy.com/\">Sam And
  Fuzzy</a> is a comic about a loser and his psychotic bear.  It started out as clever
  psychotic bear jokes, but then started weaving itself into a huge, complex, and
  excessively silly tale about the Ninja Mafia, a demon refridgerator, a metal band,
  and an evil record company.  It has a distinctive black and white style and is very,
  very strange.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.licd.com/\">Least I Could Do</a> is a comic
  about a perverted, sugar-obsessed CEO and his assorted friends.  The artwork is
  professional and smooth, ever since Lar DeSouza joined as the artist a couple of
  years ago.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.thebookofbiff.com/\">The Book Of Biff</a> is
  essentially a huge list of things you should never do.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.sheldoncomics.com/\">Sheldon</a>
  is about a boy-genius millionaire, his talking duck, and his grandfather.  It's
  essentially the same format as a weekly newspaper comic, just a little funnier.
  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.starslip.com/\">Starslip Crisis</a> is an ongoing serial
  about a flying museum. In space.  Kristopher Straub, from the ole' Checkerboard
  Nightmare comics is responsible for this travesty.  Good thing is, though, it's
  way better than the Checkerboard Nightmare comics.  Plus, you can get a \"Lincoln
  Shot First\" T-Shirt. Coolbeans.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.basicinstructions.net/\">Basic
  Instructions</a> is a series of four-panel sets of instructions on how to do things.
  The only way to really get the point is to read the comic. Do it. DO IT!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.threepanelsoul.com/\">Three
  Panel Soul</a> is a continuation of the <a href=\"http://www.machall.com/\">Mac
  Hall</a> saga, after those persons responsible for Mac Hall stopped making the comic
  and stopped going to university.  The black-and-white style is amazing, but the
  jokes just aren't as funny as they used to be.  \n\n<a href=\"http://wondermark.com/\">Wondermark</a>
  is a comic composed of attaching word bubbles to old illustrations. Classy!\n\n<a
  href=\"http://www.wetherobots.com/\">We The Robots</a> has appeared a lot on Reddit
  lately- it's good times. They go out of their way to be as depressing as possible,
  and do a pretty good job at it.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.dresdencodak.com/\">Dresden
  Codak</a> updates rarely. The author is clearly a fan of science fiction, secular
  humanism,  and Ray Kurzweil, so it makes for some neat reading.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.kiwisbybeat.com/minus.html\">Minus</a>
  is a pretty watercolour comic about a little magic girl named Minus. \n\n<a href=\"http://anderslovesmaria.reneengstrom.com/\">Anders
  Loves Maria</a> is a really well-drawn comic about a relationship between Anders
  and Maria, and I'm still not sure if I like it, yet. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.asofterworld.com/\">A
  Softer World</a> is poetry, timed well enough to be clever and funny.\n\nFinally,
  <a href=\"http://nofoolscomics.com/\">No Fools</a> is from Dylan Innes, an ol' Peak
  Contributor. It's a funny comic, but it doesn't update often enough. DY-LAN! \n\nMy
  advice is, as always, start reading from the beginning.  Except with \"Least I Could
  Do\", which isn't really worth reading before Lar DeSouza came on to do the art. "
