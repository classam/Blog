  I''m not sure exactly how this happened, but Cake has gone and done it. They''ve
  released the <a href="http://cakemusic.com/songs/rarities/03MahnaFADE.mp3">catchiest
  song in all of history</a>. There is no escape. You are screwed. By clicking on
  that link, you have consigned yourself to hours and hours of having a cover of "Mahna
  Mahna" in your head.'
