  with them for a second year.  I think, though, it might be time for me to move to
  a new host, soon.  Maybe 8 months from now.  Not that I haven't been happy with
  DreamHost, but there are a few things that I want to fix.\n\n<b>1. Occasional Bouts
  Of Slow </b>\nWhen it comes down to it, sometimes my blog is just slow.  REEAL slow.
  \ It's unprofessional, darn it. \n\n<b>2. Everything Is Automatic </b>\nThe \"One-Click
  Installs\" make me feel like a retarded person.  I like being able to install new
  instances of Wordpress in One-Click, and the One-Click upgrades are nice, too, but
  they still feel too easy.  I want some difficulty.  I can handle software installation
  on my own, and it makes me feel more like I can control my destiny.\n\n<b>3. The
  High-Capacity Is Useless </b>\nYay, I have tonnes of bandwidth and disk space. With
  the speed and thin-pipe that I seem to be stuck with, though, filling that disk-space
  is a non-issue and using that bandwith doesn't seem too much of a problem either.
  \ What's the point of ridiculous amounts of storage and bandwidth if you can't even
  come close to using it all? \n\n<b>4. More Control. </b>\nWhen it comes down to
  it, I want to experiment with Ruby On Rails, with Django and Python, with Lisp and
  whatever the hell framework works with Lisp, and everything else out there.  I'm
  young and promiscuous (at least when it comes to new technologies) and DreamHost
  is just holding me back. I want to run my own server! Oh, I know, if *I'm* in charge
  of my own server it's going to break way more often and be filled with security
  holes like some sort of swissed-cheese, but it's worth it for the freedom and knowledge
  I'd gain.\n\nSo, that's three reasons. And then one more, fourth, reason.\n\nI've
  been recommended <a href=\"http://www.slicehost.com/\">slicehost</a> for a good
  solid VPS, so I'll be taking a look at that. Later.\n\nThing is, though, I could
  just run a dev-server on my home computer, and anything I want on there. I don't
  have anything yet that needs to be deployed on a better server.  It can wait. "
