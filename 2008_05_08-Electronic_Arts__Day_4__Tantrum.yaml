content: ! "I'm frustrated all to hell today. It seems like everything has gone wrong
  at every turn. \n\nI wrote a great big blog post detailing every shitty little thing
  that's happened to me today, but the grand point of it all is that my day has been
  full of a whole boatload of minor annoyances that normally wouldn't bother me too
  much at all, except to contribute to a general feeling of irritation. \n\nBut when
  one thing really pisses you off, all of the rest of those things go from minor annoyances
  to great-big-fucking-deals, and by the end of the day you just want to shriek and
  pull on your hair and cry and punch stuff and generally throw a queen mother of
  a hissy fit. \n\nOf course, if you're over the age of 12, you probably don't, but
  inside your head that's exactly what's going on.  \n\nThe thing that's been pissing
  me off has been ASP.NET.  I've been recently exposed to it- and as a nebulous concept
  that I don't have to expressly deal with, it's not bad.  As something that I actually
  have to work with, though, it's generating a great deal of deep personal not-happy.
  \ ASP.NET is Microsoft's answer to Java's JSP technology- as if there weren't enough
  bloated, weighty structure-heavy ways to try to do web programming while steadfastly
  trying to avoid dealing with a web-server or actual HTML code. \n\nI was hoping
  that- being web programming- my LAMP proficiency would make this a much easier and
  faster technology to get a grasp on.  What would have been a better intro, I think,
  would be if I had instead spent far too much time working with Java's excessive
  class hierarchies or Microsoft's idiosyncratic CLR.\n\nBut with this albatross hanging
  over my shoulders - the combination of stress because I don't know how things work,
  the frantic feeling of being under the gun (because I need to learn this, and yesterday),
  and the innate anger at having to deal with big clumsy Java clones instead of small,
  modular FOSS technologies - this has made me less patient with every other element
  of my workspace.\n\nA co-worker joking around with me (\"Oh, yeah, co-ops don't
  do any work in the first few days\", \"We need to get you working harder.\") goes
  from an annoyance to a mortal insult- I want to yell at him. I'm busting my balls,
  here. \n\nLittle annoyances pile up- there's no menu in the cafeteria, just Powerpoint
  presentations that are incomplete, so I have no way of knowing what I can order
  or what half of the items on display are (or how much they cost.).  \n\nThe Library
  is surprisingly tiny and has maybe 4 ASP.NET books, none of them any good, even
  though ASP.NET is the de-facto web programming framework for most of the company.
  \n\nI can't listen to music in my cubicle because my headphones won't reach the
  back of my computer. Nobody seems to be listening to music around here, even though
  the working space is small enough that a little sound-induced privacy would be a
  godsend.  Maybe it's because the process for listening to music at your desk can
  be quite technically involved- you need at the minimum to hunt down a headphone
  extender, then buy and burn a DVD full of mp3's and keep it in your computer at
  all times because having mp3 files on your hard drive is strictly forbidden. \n\nThe
  cubicle space is small.  Two cubicles are shared by 4 people, working in a square
  with an employee at each corner.  With 4 people in a cubicle, you feel guilty whenever
  you leave your desk or don't look busy.  All of the fancy perks in the world don't
  matter if you don't feel comfortable leaving your desk long enough to actually use
  them.  There's always noise about, lots of noise. Like always, managers are in private
  offices, so the people who need to concentrate and relax and think clearly are in
  the centre of things surrounded by others, while the people who need to communicate
  constantly and keep on the pulse of things are sequestered away in private offices.
  \n\nYour teammates are happy to answer your questions, but they're also super busy,
  so you feel guilty interrupting them and I can't get my printer working because
  the network permissions are set up wrong, so I'm going to have to wrangle with IT
  \ and I have a long commute so I can't stay late and I'll be home late anyways and
  AAARGGGGHHH.\n\nI can see some of the reasons why people think of EA as a grind.
  \ I bet if I sleep for a half-decent amount of time, though, I'll feel a lot better.
  \ I also get to see Kristen tomorrow, so that's a bonus. "
