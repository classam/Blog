  Punch</a> I described Potater, a startup concept I was developing, and the company
  that already does most of what I imagined that Potater would do - <a href=\"http://disqus.com/\">Disqus</a>.
  \ In the comments you can find much of the justification for while I'll probably
  end up building Potater anyways. \n\nSo now, I've decided to put the entire design
  process online, and ask that you comment on each stage with thoughts, ideas for
  improvement, and what-have-you. </em>\n\nLet's start with the elevator pitch for
  Potater.  What is Potater?\n\n<strong>Potater is a tool for annotating URI's with
  additional data. </strong> \n\nWhat possible use could that be? Well, first of all,
  let's imagine that the web works roughly the way that it is 'supposed' to - everything
  has a URI, one that, largely, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI\">doesn't
  change</a>.  If there is a <a href=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/images/android_hell.jpg\">picture</a>,
  it is just a picture. What sort of metadata could we possibly add to a picture?
  \n\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>Discussion</strong>: Comments. (\"What the hell? A tree?\")
  </li>\n<li> <strong>Summary</strong>: A description of the picture. (\"A tree\")
  (\"A tree with a dude behind it\") (\"Two trees.\")</li> \n<li> <strong>Taxonomy</strong>:
  Tags for the picture. (\"Trees\") </li>\n<li> <strong>Context</strong>: Where was
  the picture taken? Why? With what sort of camera, using which settings? </li>\n<li>
  <strong>Rating</strong>: Some measure of notability or popularity. ( \"This is interesting.\"
  \ \"This is not interesting.\" ) </li>\n</ul>\n\nNow, this all seems a little feature-heavy
  for a picture  Complicated, hard-to-implement, what-have-you.  Let us simplify.\n\nWe
  can combine \"Summary\", \"Context\", and \"Discussion\" into a single <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=944\">intelligent
  commenting system</a>, folding in \"Rating\" as a method of organizing comments.
  \n\nWe can use tagging to sort all of the data, autotagging a URL with it's 'host'
  at the very minimum. \n\nNow, what use is all of this data?  Well, for one, it becomes
  easy for a website to view or load comments on any arbitrary 'thing' - just link
  to <code>potater.com?URI</code>, or pull data from <code>potater.com?URI</code>
  to populate a comments field.  \n\nOn top of that, <em>we</em> now have access to
  a block of data - a huge collection of URI's that are interesting enough for people
  to want to comment on them- if we're lucky, they're even tagged.  If we play our
  cards right, we can pick an arbitrary tag (\"javascript\"), determine the N highest
  ranked articles for that tag, for that day, and cram them into a RSS feed. \n\nBuilding
  a forum or a community just requires the creation of a 'tag'.  Being as URI's don't
  actually have to *lead* anywhere, 'empty' URI metadata can just be a discussion
  on any ol' topic. (See reddit's 'self' posts.)\n\nOf course, the 'underlying flexibiliy'
  of the software need not be revealed everywhere.  While the 'base functionality'
  of Potater may be flexible and open, the systems that are built on top of it (Potater
  Commentator, Potater Forumator, Potater Communitator, Potater Aggregator...) can
  be simple and single-task. "
