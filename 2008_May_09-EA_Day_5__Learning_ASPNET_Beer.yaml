content: ! "A little bit of sleep and I feel much better.\n\nToday I've been learning
  about ASP.NET all day- I finally found a good reference online (Programming ASP.NET
  3rd Ed., O'Reilly) which significantly improved my mood, and I've committed to learning
  it- which could take a couple of days to get a bit of a grasp on, and a bit of hacking
  to really get a handle on. \n\nI managed to find where they post the cafeteria menus
  online. \n\nInterruptions are frequent around the desk- conversations, and food,
  and meetings- but I'm making forward progress. \n\nAnd, at the end of the day, they
  rolled a cart over filled with ice cold, expensive beers- Heineken, Guinness, Stella,
  all sorts of different alcohol variations, a few soft drinks, and a veritable plethora
  of snacks that I've barely touched for fear of ruining my dinner with Kristen.  \n\nTouche',
  EA. Touche'. \n\n"
