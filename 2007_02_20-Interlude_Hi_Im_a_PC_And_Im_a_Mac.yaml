content: ! 'Okay, so here''s an <a href="http://blog.wired.com/cultofmac/1996-macaddict-mac-vs-pc.jpg">ad</a>
  from Mac in 1996 that''s creepily similar to the new "And I''m a PC" ads that you''ll
  see today.

  The only difference? Looking back on the 11-year-old ad, the PC guy looks a good
  three times as cool. He looks ''evil robot'' cool. Someone may have sent an army
  of him + clones back in time to kill Steve Jobs, we don''t know. I don''t think
  the dorky-lookin'' Mac guy could stand in his way for any length of time.


  And in the new Mac vs. PC commercials, the PC is represented by John Hodgeman, a
  man awesome enough to just start naming hoboes and never stop.


  I think Mac is trying to send us a message: The Mac you''re using may be trendy
  and cool now, but eventually (like all trendy items) it will become as passe as
  an all-denim wardrobe, tye-dye shirts, or (eventually) having a bulky white music
  device constantly clipped on to your person. A PC is awesome forever.'
