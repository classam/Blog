  <img src="http://www.tony-os.com/images/logo.png" alt="Tony-O''s Logo" />


  This is a logo that I developed for Tony-O''s Restaurant, a little cafe in Surrey
  - currently closed thanks to financial difficulties.  Around the logo, a <a href="http://www.tony-os.com">full
  website</a> was designed.


  One of the major advantages of this website is in it''s flexible layout- the size
  of the page adjusts to accommodate the browser in which it''s displayed.  Tested
  in Safari, Internet Explorer 7+, and Firefox 1.5+, it''s consistent and standards
  compliant. '
