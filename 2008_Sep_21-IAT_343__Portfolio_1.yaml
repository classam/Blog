  \n\nAs for a quick breakdown of the items in the scene, the book was created with
  an extrude, two planars, and a couple of lofts, which were then duplicated and flipped
  around to form the other half of the book. \n\nThe lamp was all about the revolve
  command- both the base and the shade.  The bulb is a modified NURBS sphere.  The
  cord is extruded. The fun bits of the lamp mostly revolved around trying to make
  it work as a light-source for the scene- there are two 'spot' lights (one pointing
  down through the bottom of the shade, one pointing up through the top- this becomes
  more apparent in a shot that's further away), one 'ambient' light (to keep the room
  visible, even in unlit areas) - and a 'spot' light inside the lamp to provide general
  warmth to the scene.  All of the lights are 'yellow', because most house-lights
  are yellow (not white). \n\nThe pencils are polygonal cylinders, so chosen because
  they lend well to UV-texturing- which I then used to paint the pencil-bits on in
  Photoshop. The cup the pencils are sitting in is .. revolved. Poorly. Don't look
  too closely at it, you might hurt your eyes. \n\nThe table is a plank.  It's bump-mapped
  a bit so that the reflections on it wobble. \n"
