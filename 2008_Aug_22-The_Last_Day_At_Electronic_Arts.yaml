content: ! "So, today's my last day at Electronic Arts- Woo, freedom!  It's hard to
  believe I've been doing this for 4 months! \n\nAnd now I'm free, free as a bird,
  at least for the next week, at which point I have to return to school to have more
  information forcefully drilled into my skull.  \n\nWhat would I say about EA? It's
  not nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  The \"horrible grind\" that's so legendary
  working here has hardly come into play.  I just built things with C#, showed them
  to people, and then escaped in a puff of smoke- similar to my last job at Research
  in Motion. (Except at Research in Motion, it was PHP.)\n\nWould I come back? Yeah,
  sure. Honestly, my supervisor's going off to a new department to work on a project
  that, while potentially doomed to fail, at least seems like a really interesting
  concept to work on.\n\nAs for me, I'm off to a semester of freelancing- even though
  I haven't lined up any clients or potential work, yet.  I suspect that through the
  power of luck and my fantastic eyebrows, I'll find something to do for money.  If
  anything, I could always teach myself Flash."
