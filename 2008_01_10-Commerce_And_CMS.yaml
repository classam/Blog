content: ! "Though my time spent fiddling with assorted web technomologies, the three
  most common things anybody has ever wanted to put up have been blogs, e-commerce,
  and content-management-systems. It's always been those three things, again and again,
  ad infinitum.\n\nNow, I've spent enough time fiddling with Wordpress to really know
  my way around it- I'm comfortable with it, and at least familiar enough not to step
  on my own toes. It's a good, extensible blogging package. If I were to want to do
  some major work around it, I might want to start with a more sparse package, but
  for what it's for, Wordpress does nicely. \n\nAs for commerce and CMS, though, I've
  never really encountered anything that I've liked. In the e-commerce packages that
  I'm familiar with, OsCommerce is a mess, ZenCart is little better, and there are
  companies upon companies selling crappy midmarket solutions for commerce that I
  don't even want to touch.\n\nFor CMS software, I've encountered Drupal and Plone,
  both of which are not great fun to work with but not too terrible either. I haven't
  had a lot of experience with either, though, really.  \n\nTo here's my question
  to you- what the hell does one use for commerce and CMS that doesn't suck?  Flexibility
  and skinnability are big 'yes-yes' factors for this sort of thing, as well as security
  and some amount of ease-of-use. \n\nDom? Rob? Anyone? "
