content: ! "I'd like to alert you to a tragedy.\n\nA tragedy happening under your
  very nose.\n\nThousands of children worldwide are born- in orphanages, hospitals,
  even low-income areas of this very country- without names.\n\nBe it because they
  cannot accurately trace their lineage, or simply because nobody has bothered to
  pay attention to them, they grow up without that simplest of human dignities- a
  name.\n\nCurrently, North Americans are enjoying a name boom.  Everybody is guaranteed
  two names- even three or four in the case of some more affluent families.\n\nNames
  are becoming so common that many people are just discarding unused parts of their
  name.  Many professors, teachers, and doctors discard their first names entirely
  in pursuit of professionalism, while models, rock-stars, and butlers often ignore
  their last names completely.\n\nA recent medical study shows that over 85% of North
  Americans don't use their middle names at all! What a waste!\n\nI won't even mention
  the rash of nicknames currently spreading across America.\n\nSo I call upon you-
  the kind, caring readers of my blog- to consider donating the unused parts of your
  name.\n\nIt doesn't even need to be a full name- Is your name Jonathan?  You can
  contribute 'Jo' and keep 'Nathan' for yourself. Every little bit counts. \n\nSome
  names <em>you know</em> are names that have been built by charity.  Christopher
  Bayes and Mary Grace Quinn donated enough of their names to piece together the name
  'Topher Grace'- donated to an orphan who eventually became a star of film and screen.\n\nThose
  of us at the Name Institute of America hope that you find it in your heart to ensure
  that those unused bits of your name go towards a good cause.  If you're interested
  in more details about donating, please call 1-888-YOU-NAME for a consultation.\n\nThank
  you for your time."
