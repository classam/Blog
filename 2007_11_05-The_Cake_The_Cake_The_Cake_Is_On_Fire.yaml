content: ! "Have you heard of Portal? It's a cleverly written, cleverly executed game
  where an AI that combines bureaucratic efficiency and utter disregard for human
  life leads the player through a series of deadly mazes that can only be navigated
  with the use of a 'portal' gun that allows players to create portals from place
  to place.\n\nSome clever DigiPen students (DigiPen is the premier game development
  school in North America) produced \"Narbacular Drop\" as a final project, some time
  ago. It was a cleverly written, cleverly executed game where an AI that combined
  bureaucratic efficiency and utter disregard for human life led the player through
  a series of deadly mazes that could only be navigated with the use of a 'portal'
  gun that would allow players to create portals from place to place.  They were hired
  by Valve to turn Narbacular Drop into a full-fledged game, and Portal certainly
  has all of it's fledges.  \n\nThe best part of the game, however, is the clever,
  clever writing.  Curious? Here's <a title=\"Portal Script\" href=\"http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/file/934386/50477\">the
  entire script to the game</a>. It's good reading. (Oh, and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RthZgszykLs\">the
  song at the end</a> was great, too)\n\n<blockquote style=\"padding: 5px 10px 5px

  part of this test.\"\n </blockquote>"
