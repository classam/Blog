  Something that is a triumph of engineering.  Something beautiful and perfect in
  it's own little way.  Something that I do not want.\n\nYes, if you're an internet
  denizen, you've heard about the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macbookair/\">MacBook
  Air</a> seventeen times over already by now.  For those of you who've not heard
  of it, it's Apple's new contender in the ultraportable arena.  The MacBook Air is
  ridiculously thin and light (a mere 3 pounds, and thinner than a finger), as powerful
  as a traditional 'heavy-as-shit' laptop, and pretty inexpensive for an ultraportable.
  Cool.  I'm drooling over it right now.\n\nThey didn't have room for a replaceable
  battery or an optical media drive. Or a firewire port. Or an ethernet port. Or more
  than one USB port. But being that it's an ultraportable, it's not the sort of thing
  that really is supposed to stand alone- it's a supplementary computer, meant to
  travel with you and then sync with your home computer.  It's for the type of Apple
  consumer that doesn't worry about money- the ultraportable market, really. \n\nThe
  thing is, though, the ultraportable market has just recently been turned completely
  on it's head by the Asus Eee PC.  For 1/6th of the price of the $1800 Macbook, you
  can get a tiny Eee PC.  It has a small keyboard and a small screen, but thanks to
  it's portability and low pricing point, thousands of people are making it their
  mobile PC.  <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/01/eee-pc-review-roundup/\">It's
  widely considered to be a well-designed little fellow</a>.\n\nThe big selling point
  of the Eee, though, is the price tag.  Most of us cheap CS types are used to having
  just enough money for one computer- so we get a hefty-bag low-end Dell laptop, enough
  to fill our portable desires while still functioning acceptably as a home computer
  unit.  \n\nCase-in-point, my current layout, a Compaq Presario V6000. It was on
  sale last Christmas for Boxing Day, a steal at $599- for a 1.7Ghz Celeron with 512Mb
  of RAM and 100Gb of hard drive space.  At the time, computers with similar specs
  were going for $899+.  Currently, 100% of my computing tasks are accomplished on
  said laptop, even though it's a hefty 7lbs to lug around with an abysmal battery
  life (it's down to about 10 minutes) and little upgradeability (okay, now it's 2Gb
  of RAM, but that's about it.)  \n\nNow, thanks to the Eee and the low price of most
  towers, we can rock a <a title=\"Fuck you, HP.\" href=\"http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?sku_id=BDL10002460&logon=&langid=EN&MSCSProfile=3C79F0C7EA3162B25DCF0857B6387C8EB293700C358249C3E8CED68AB4F48BD35A736FC3C01D07DF222E18F349E7F22883529CA95D97EA3BA24769264E0E71DB6567C2F79738DEFC85065FE815F707AE3BF0DC1359EB180EAFBFE6F27AEFE84B424BD22C2221FD4E6937BDAF1C967337EF2143A800B4E1FE\">powerful
  home system</a> and a highly portable scaled-down system, all for under $1000.  "
