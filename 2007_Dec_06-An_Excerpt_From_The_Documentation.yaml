content: ! "I'm working on documenting the stuff that I've built this semester so
  that the next guy to come along doesn't pull out his hair and/or commit suicide.
  \n\nHere's some of my classiest stuff from the documentation.  Mmm, professionalism.
  \n\n\n<h4 style=\"padding-top:20px;\"> Misc: Generate a Password That's Not Very
  Random.</h4>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div style=\"padding:10px 10px 10px 10px;background-color:
  black;color: lime;font-family: monospace;\">\n\t\t\tinclude( PATH . \"Tools/Misc.php\"
  );<br />\n\t\t\t$password = generateRandomPassword();<br>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\nThis
  will generate a password that is not altogether too secure, but is probably a lot
  of fun to try to say, like \"welimuw0ogrt\", \"8aphapww\" or \"kroofchu\".\n\n\n<h4
  style=\"padding-top:20px;\"> Misc: Mock the User.</h4>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div style=\"padding:10px
  10px 10px 10px;background-color: black;color: lime;font-family: monospace;\">\n\t\t\tinclude(
  PATH . \"Tools/Misc.php\" );<br />\n\t\t\t$nickname = generateRandomCondescendingNickname();<br
  />\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\nSometimes, you feel the need to call the user something that
  seems respectful, but in retrospect was actually kind of condescending.  While using
  the user's name is easily possible, see \"Session Management\" above - it's more
  fun to call them 'tiger'.\n\nThis function merely selects from a list of such condesending
  nicknames- 'captain', 'tiger', 'chief', 'champ', 'sport', \"boss\", 'buddy', 'bucko'
  or 'kiddo'.\n\nFor reasons that are painfully obvious, this feature is closely integrated
  with the Error module."
