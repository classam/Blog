content: ! "Thanks to daylight-savings time, these changes took me an unexpected hour-and-a-half.
  \n\nI removed the line of code responsible for scrambling everybody's names in the
  comments. (It was fun while it lasted, but it was starting to descend into jerkery.)\n\nI
  added dates to individual post-pages, I switched from all-caps to upper-lower-all-caps,
  I increased the size of navigational elements, and moved the dates a little bit
  closer to the post titles.  My CSS file is still really short.\n\nTomorrow morning,
  I should check to make sure I haven't pooched the XHTML validation. It's time for
  bed- it's <em>surprisingly</em> late.  "
