  with linux.

  The Intel GMA 950 is not well supported by Ubuntu and requires a special plugin
  (called 915resolution, finding which took a couple of hours).

  The Broadcom 4311 built-in wireless chipset requires a painful NDISWRAPPER kludge.
  (That was 2.5 hours I''ll never get back. I hate working with NDISWRAPPER.)

  But I''ve figured those things out! Huzzah for now! The solutions are in my log
  book, and as long as I don''t lose said linux-log, I should never have to frustratedly
  search the internet looking for the correct Ubuntu Howto again! (so many of them
  fail, you have to absorb the wisdom of 5 or 6 and read about your computer''s specific
  parts to find a solution to your problem..grah!)


  Edit: I''m pretty sure both of these problems were solved in Ubuntu 7.10'
