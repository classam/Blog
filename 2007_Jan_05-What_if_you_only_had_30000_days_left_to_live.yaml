content: ! 'You see a lot of bad film promos: "What if you only had 30 days left to
  live?", imagining everything one would try to cram in if one only had 30 days left
  to live.. well, I think it would be funny if someone did a movie promo with a twenty-something
  sitting on a couch.

  *eats a potato chip*

  "Not much, huh?"

  *eats another potato chip*

  "Yeah, keep on eating those potato chips, there, pal."'
