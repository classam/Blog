  So, I went to The Peak&#39;s annual &quot;The Peak&quot; retreat. We went up to
  <a href="http://www.teaguehouse.com/">Teague House</a>, which is just north of Hope.  I
  met most of the people involved in The Peak&#39;s current operations, chatted with
  them about important Peak business (Beer me!, and then put a newspaper over my face
  and had a nap on a sunny field.

  The house was nice- it was almost like a cabin, except with more old stuff in it.
  &#39;Cause it&#39;s over 100 years old, the house, or at least it&#39;s been restored
  so that it looks like it did a hundred years ago. It would have felt neat, except
  it felt almost exactly like my grandparents&#39; house before they moved out- the
  house that was built by my great-grandfather around 1905- On Lassam Rd., in Richmond
  (That&#39;s my family&#39;s road!). <img src="http://www.sfu.ca/~kkerr/curtis/Ahoy.JPG"

  Thusly, the Peak retreat is over. I&#39;m packing up for my next trip, Cultus Lake,
  and I&#39;m spending most of the week with Kristen- first, her birthday (TODAY!),
  then, the FAS Formal, then, the camping trip.

  Woo!'
