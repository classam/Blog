content: ! "The comic <a href=\"http://dresdencodak.com/\">Dresden Codak</a> is now
  updating weekly.  This is a Very Good Thing. The art is lush, the characters are
  compelling, and <a href=\"http://dresdencodak.com/cartoons/dc_034.htm\">this comic</a>
  is the best thing ever.   (And don't think I haven't had that same Ray Kurzweil
  fantasy myself, airship and all.) \n\nAlso? Tiny Carl Jung."
