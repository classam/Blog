content: ! "<em>\"<a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?cat=24\">Design & Typography</a>\"
  articles cover a topic near and dear to my heart: Making things look pretty. </em>\n\nHead
  to <a href=\"http://google.ca\">google.ca</a> for a second, I want to show you something.\n\nWhen
  you load the page, you are faced with the standard Google interface.  Logo.  Search
  box. Two buttons. That's it, that's all she wrote.  Very plain, very Google.  \n\nGive
  it a second.  In a puff of sudden smoke, the rest of the site elements reveal themselves.
  \ Advanced Search, Language Tools, The Google App Brigade, Copyright, the works.
  Everything is still nicely minimalist, but all of the options that are <em>anything
  but search</em> have arrived. \n\nInteresting UI technique, there.  Display the
  most important elements first (and fast!), and then, after they've caught the user's
  eye, fill in all of the peripherals.  It's almost unnoticeable, and certainly subtle.
  \n\nNeat. "
