content: ! 'Friday was my Calculus test. (Ow, my brain). I slept all day, the Friday
  before  the test, and was awake all night before the test trying (in vain) to drill
  some  of the concepts in Calculus into my shallow brain.&nbsp; I took the test,
  and  answered 90% of the questions. Of course, when it comes down to it, I know
  that  the Calculus TA&#39;s are viciously hard markers, and just because my answer
  to a  test question might be mostly correct, that won&#39;t stop them from viciously  pointing
  out that I forgot to remember to add a constant &quot;C&quot; at the end of the  equation.
  You lose 2 marks out of 5!... Well, considering my rather tepid  performance (65-72%)&nbsp;on
  earlier tests, tests which I had pegged, at the time, as  having been easy A&#39;s,
  I was certain that my marks on my calculus test would be  low, probably much lower
  than the mark that I had imagined in the test room.&nbsp;  And, lo and behold, last
  night when I recieved my marks back, I had a mere 56.5%  on my hands, test-wise.
  Combined with my marks in the course (noting that, in  the 8 months I&#39;ve spent
  in Calc 2, I&#39;ve completed maybe 10% of my homework) .. I  end up with a proud,
  glorious C-, the minimum requirement to never, ever, ever  have to take Calculus
  again. *I&#39;m siiiingin&#39; in the raain... oh siingin&#39; in the  rain.. what
  a glorious feeeelin&#39; I&#39;m haaaappy again.. *


  Having duly  mangled my Calculus test, I slept until 1:00 in the morning on Sunday.&nbsp;
  An  awkward time to wake up, fully rested, mind you.&nbsp; I managed to stay awake
  for 26  or 27 more hours, and entertained myself with a few bad movies, breakfast
  with  family, some shopping with family, a dinner with family, and a boring  board-style-game
  with family. Also? HAM!

  There&#39;s nothing in the world quite  so special as a spiral-cut honey-glazed
  baked ham. Carnivorous villain that I  am, I&#39;m not a huge fan of any of the
  really time-intensive meals. Turkey?  Boring. Roast Beef? Meh. The only huge family
  meal that turns my proverbial  crank is a big ham, the truest expression of love
  that can be embodied as a  cured, smoked, glazed and cooked pig corpse! Glee!'
