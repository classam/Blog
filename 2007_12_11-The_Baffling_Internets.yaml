  Livevideo</a>, and one from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBGIQ7ZuuiU\">YouTube</a>.
  \ You don't actually have to watch the videos- they're just more of the generic
  inane videos that you'll find everywhere on internet.  \n\nWhat you'll notice looking
  at the two pages is that they're .. well, almost exactly the same.  Now, I'm placing
  the blame squarely on Livevideo, here.  The question is, why?\n\nI mean, how did
  this get made?  Did someone actually go to venture capitalists and angel investors
  pitching the genius idea, \"Let's just make YouTube\"?  Were they planning something
  better, but just failed to put it together right? Did someone actually imagine that
  just flat-out copying YouTube was a great idea that would make tonnes of money?\n\nI
  mean, this one's so painfully obvious, I don't even think it's necessary to point
  out <a href=\"http://www.ericsink.com/laws/Law_06.html\">Rule #6</a> of Ries & Trout's
  \"22 Laws Of Marketing\".  \n\nThis is almost a <a href=\"http://www.zango.com/\">Zango</a>
  level of stupid. \n\nIf companies like this are getting venture capital, I'm curious
  how long web developers are going to be working in Aeron chairs before we're back
  to flipping burgers. "
