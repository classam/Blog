  alt=\"You are fat.\" />\n\nObesity has been a problem for hackers, for time immemorial
  &mdash; With the wide variety of gourmet treats available at the wave of a hand,
  it's hard not to pack on pounds.\n\nI implore you, though, think about your body.
  \ Rapid-weight-loss therapy and body-sculpting are both viable solutions to keep
  you looking trim, but your food and exercise choices affect more than just your
  appearance.  A diet of nothing but caffeine, sugar, fat and carbohydrates will leave
  you with sweaty, energetic highs, sore headachey lows, and creamy delicious middles.
  It's a greasy, lazy, nasty way to live, and even the best geriatricists will have
  a hard time getting you into the triple-digits with a diet like that. \n\nSo try
  this: Choke down some vegetables and grains, and exercise, even if just a little.
  \ You'll feel better and live longer, unless you get hit by a bus. \n\nThose of
  you who know me know that this is a serious case of pot-calling-the-kettle-black.
  \ It's good advice, though, even if I don't follow it. \n\nSo, you know what I'm
  going to do? For the next week, I'm going to get around manually.  That means I
  walk or take transit.  No hoverchair, no Segway, no automatically precomputed dynamic
  paths.\n\nI won't get any work done, but I'll see the city and get some exercise.\n\nLove
  & Kisses &mdash; J. Random Hacker"
