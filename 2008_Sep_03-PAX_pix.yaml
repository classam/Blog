content: ! "How does one summarize the Penny Arcade Expo?  I mean, without having
  to worry about all of the work and difficulty of carefully planned exposition. \n\nWe
  drove across the border, along to a carefully chosen selection of funky jams.  Being
  as we left at 6:00 in the morning, the border crossing took almost no time. \n\nHaving
  arrived in Seattle, we hunted for a breakfast place.  We found a small Hawaiian
  cafe, serving various combinations of egg, bacon, and cheese.\n\nThere were many
  beanbags- we lost one of our travelling party to their gaping, beany maws. \n\n<img

  the beanbags.\" />\n\nWe left Kiyomi behind, to fend for herself with the beanbags,
  and stood in line.  \n\nAnd stood in line.\n\nAnd stood in line. \n\nWe waited in
  line for 30 minutes, and were then presented with... the main line. We had been
  waiting in the pre-line line for the past 30 minutes. The main line was spectacular.
  \ \n\nHaving seen the line (one of PAX's biggest attractions), we retreated to attempt
  to rescue Kiyomi from the bags, but we were instead engulfed.  We spent the better
  part of 2 hours fighting with the beany hulks. \n\nWe retreated for lunch at a delightful
  Mexican stereotype, then returned in time for the expo to start. \n\n<img src=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/images/pax/falcon_punch.jpg\"
  alt=\"Falcon punch!\" />\n\nCaptain Falcon falcon-punched his way into my heart.\n\n<img

  floating, disembodied head of Jonathan Coulton commanded me to get his autograph.
  \ I did. That and Freezepop, the Minibosses, and the OneUps.  I now have mad CD's,
  as well. \n\nWe ate at Von's that night.  They had barbequed just-about-everything.
  \ My younger brother demonstrated the proper system of barbeque safety.\n\n<img

  The OneUps, Freezepop, and Jonathan Coulton- was fantastic.  Freezepop finished
  with Europe's Final Countdown, and JC rickrolled the audience.  \n\nHe knows the
  rules, and so do I. \n\nOn day 2, we woke up, and bought more breakfast sandwiches.
  Delicious breakfast sandwiches.\n\nTime was spent at the Expo hall, wandering and
  glorying in delicious commercialism.  I acquired a \"Your Mom Is A Classy Lady\"
  shirt, as well as a shirt featuring Inky, Blinky, and Clyde (not Pinky, though).
  \n\nLunch at Johnny Rockets.  We had burgers, onion rings, milkshakes, and chili
  fries.  Healthy.\n\nThen Team Fortress 2.  Kristen took to it a lot faster than
  I'd have hoped.  \n\nDinner at the Asaggio- highly expensive Italian food.  Also
  highly delicious.\n\nThat night, we played Carcassonne and Apples To Apples in the
  games room. \n\nNotably, we found a beholder, which ate Kiyomi. \n\n<img src=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/images/pax/mouth_of_the_beholder.jpg\"
  alt=\"Kiyomi is in the mouth of the beholder!\" />\n\nThe day after that, there
  was more Team Fortress 2 (Kristen's getting pretty good with the soldier) and some
  delicious chowder at a chowderery. Chowderhouse.  Chowder.. place. \n\nThen, we
  crossed the border, stopping for Fruity Pebbles and Thomas Kemper beverages. \n\nFun
  was had by all. Woo PAX! "
