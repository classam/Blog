content: ! "I recently discovered a site (thanks, Reddit!) called \"<a href=\"http://dearadobe.com/top_rated.php\">Dear
  Adobe</a>\", where people gripe about their various beefs with Adobe's software.\n\nIt's
  a very consistent set- the top 100 are pretty much: \n\n1. Everything is too expensive.\n2.
  For non-Americans, everything is EXTRA-too-expensive.\n3. Acrobat Reader is a aircraft-carrier
  when we want a Volkswagen Jetta. \n4. The Adobe Updater is the worst piece of software
  ever.  Look, we don't want to close Firefox or restart our computer- these are things
  that we don't like to do, especially when we're using your software and are therefore
  *busy*.\n5. Less \"adding features\", more \"improving stability\" and \"running
  faster\".  \n\nYeah, I agree with every single point there. And most of everything
  else on the site, but those are the most common ones. "
