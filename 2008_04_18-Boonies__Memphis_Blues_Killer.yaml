content: ! "Now, I don't know about you guys-  I worship at the altar of good barbeque.\n\nOkay,
  it all started when my mom was dating a guy who had a serious barbeque hobby- he
  had a smoker, and went to competitions.  When they broke up, I was hurt- not because
  I'd miss him, but because I'd never have those delicious mustardy smoked ribs again.
  \ They also made a Texas-style chili that turned me into a chili-lover.  This chili
  is the only concievable reason I would return to <acronym title=\"They do a chili
  competition where the local chili masters come out to play.\">the Cloverdale rodeo</acronym>,
  even risking exposing Kristen to grizzled, attractive, cowboy-hatted horse-ridin'
  men in order to get it. \n\nHours of watching the Food Network celebrate the many
  varieties of traditional southern barbeques didn't help.  \n\nBut I digress- good
  barbeque is an art, and an exceedingly rare one in Vancouver.  \n\nSo, one of my
  dad's old roommates, Boonie, has opened a little restaurant, just in the Cloverdale
  fairgrounds- inside the Curling rink.  It's more a cafeteria than a restaurant,
  really- except that there has never been a cafeteria that could prepare food of
  this calibre- or for these ridiculous prices.  \n\nNo, the venue is not exactly
  the Ritz-Carlton (or even the Taco Bell/KFC), but it doesn't need to be.  Boonie
  has a <a href=\"http://www.boonies.ca/concession.htm\">website</a>, featuring the
  location and the menu, and a few other things. It's very 1995, but it gets the basic
  idea across. \n\nEnough of that, though. The ribs will blow you clean out of the
  water. They're good.  Really good.  There are a few little Italian places (Rosa's,
  in Port Moody) that serve ribs that have been braising in tomato sauce all day,
  and those ribs are knockout delicious- but that's a totally different class of food,
  a different type of meal. If you're looking for Southern style home cookin' (with
  the apostrophe instead of the 'g'), Boonie's is the place to go.  Let's take a quick
  look at the menu.\n\n<h3>Sandwiches and Burgers </h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Boonie Burger -
  2 patties, cheese, Louisiana Hot Links ... $6.00 </li>\n<li>Pulled Pork Sandwich
  ... $5.75 </li>\n<li> Hot Link Sandwich ... $5.75 </li>\n <li> <em>~ add a half
  pound of fries (seasoned or plain)</em> ~ $1.50</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>BBQ Chicken: </h3>\n<ul>\n<li>BBQ
  Chicken: 1/2 Chicken + 2 southern side + cornbread ... $11.50 </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>BBQ
  Smoked Ribs: </h3> \n<ul>\n    <li>Sampler - 3 ribs + 1 southern side ... $6.00</li>\n
  \   <li>Small Dinner - Half rack of ribs + 1 southern side + cornbread ... $10.50
  </li>\n    <li> Large Dinner - Half rack of ribs + 2 southern sides + cornbread
  ... $13.50 </li>\n    <li> Full Meal Deal - Full Rack of ribs + 2 southern sides
  + cornbread ... $19.50 </li>\n</ul>\n<h3> Southern Sides: </h3> \n<ul>\n    <li>Mac
  'n Cheese ... $2.50</li>\n    <li>Red Beans 'n Rice ... $2.50</li>\n    <li>Blackeyed
  Peas 'n Rice ... $2.50</li>\n    <li>Collard Greens ... $2.50</li>\n    <li>Cornbread
  Muffin ... $1.25</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Desserts (when available)</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>Peach
  Cobbler ... $3.75</li>\n    <li>Sweet Potato Pie ... $3.75</li>\n    <li>Granny
  Miles Zucchini Loaf ... $3.00</li>\n</ul>\n\nNow, the first thing that you might
  notice- this food is not expensive.  A full rack of ribs is a lot of food. A 2-patty
  burger should not be reasonably possible for under $8.  It's confusing, to say the
  least. \n\nThe food is plentiful, too. The \"Full Meal Deal\" managed to fill up
  my brother.  Now, my brother, a pretty normal guy in most respects, qualifies as
  almost demi-human when it comes to his capacity for meal consumption.  He's the
  only person who's ever gone head-to-head with <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=349\">Rosa</a>
  and almost come out on top (I'm pretty sure Rosa had emergency food on the occasion
  that some champion eater came around.). He's the only person I've ever known to
  go to IHOP, point at the window at the top of the menu (the one with about 5 breakfasts
  on it, all laid out attractively), and say \"<acronym title=\" What, the sampler?
  \ No, everything. All of it.\">I want that</acronym>\".  Filling Jonathan up on
  $20 is tantamount to stopping the <acronym title=\"Much easier, now that the Mongol
  Horde is 3 LARPERS from the Middle East.\">Mongol Horde with a toothpick and a half-can
  of beans</acronym>. \n\nThe thing that the menu can't get across is the taste.  The
  ribs are worth the trip out to Cloverdale, even for those of you who regard Cloverdale
  as \"Somewhere between Vancouver and Toronto\".  Everything else on the menu is
  delicious.  I had the first 'real' pulled pork sandwich I've had in years, and I
  do plan to go back for more- I'm taking Kristen there next available opportunity.
  \n\nBoonie is tonnes of fun, if you can keep up with him. \n\nGreat food, great
  prices, no atmosphere. My highest recommendations! Go eat there now! Do it! Spread
  the word and let the joyous ribs spread across the land!"
