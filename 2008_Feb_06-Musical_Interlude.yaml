content: ! "Those of you who are slightly more observant (and aren't using RSS) might
  have noticed a few minor changes to the website.  Like, for example, the total redesign.
  \ It's still in development- there are a few things that need to be adjusted- but
  this is generally how the site's going to look.  \n\nI have to add Google Analytics,
  add some space below each post, a little o' this, a little o' that.  I have to switch
  the favicon about.  I have to do some minor tooling-about to get that XHTML-validation
  award. Maybe toss in an explanation of the caboose. Or not. \n\nThe one thing that
  won't be coming back? The blogroll. My apologies to anybody who's lost their space
  on said blogroll, but I don't think that it's a very useful feature.  I'll try to
  read your blogs and post whenever you do something interesting, instead.\n\nAlso,
  and this is my first foray into JavaScript, the site-style changes if you view it
  in a window of less than about 775 px.  Give it a try! Neat, huh?  I still have
  yet to put together a mobile stylesheet, but that shouldn't be too much difficulty.
  \n\nI've tested it in the Big Three.  I am loathe to say that I like Safari the
  best- anti-aliasing makes my giant-text decisions look snazzier.  I'll vet it on
  Opera & Opera Mini later.\n\nSo... what do you think. I DEMAND YOUR OPINIONS!"
