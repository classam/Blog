content: ! 'I realized that this week, I didn''t put any of my own comics in the Peak.
  What does that mean? That means that I can''t put anything up on the site. Maybe
  next week, foolish mortals.


  I just finished 2 midterms on Wednesday. Today was relaxing with a game of FreeCiv
  with Dan and Dom.


  I was expecting a hearty asskicking from Dan, who''s apparently a real FreeCiv devotee. 
  When the game ended, though (untimely, no winners, just people leaving to get dinner
  or nookie).. my Italy was a large world power, albeit landlocked on a tiny island.
  The AI''s America was an even more major world power, with armed calvalry poised
  to destroy Dan''s Canada. Dom''s China was almost a nonexistant entity.


  I played a pretty strong game, but I made a serious mistake- once I reached the
  edge of my natural borders (read: my civilization has reached the water) I stopped
  expanding entirely.  Next time, I''m building a fleet of Triremes and expanding
  overseas, if possible.


  I''m also not used to the fast-paced turns in FreeCiv. When I play alone, I have
  time to tailor every single factor of my Civilizations- oh, this town doesn''t have
  enough food? Well, let''s irrigate in exactly the right spot... With 2 players waiting
  on my every turn, and a crowded and unpleasant UI, I almost had no time to balance
  the factors that I usually consider so important in a game of Civilization.


  Now I really lust for more FreeCiv. The world shall me t3h mine!


  Not much relaxing, hm? Yeah, I know, I relax by getting worked up about something
  new.


  I''ve procured some Ladytron albums, and have been totally absorbed by the mad funky
  jams. "Weekend", "Jet Age", and "The Last One Standing" have been resonating in
  my head for days.


  I''m happy not to have to organize anything this Friday, but I have a lot more to
  do in the next few weeks. Movie night and Games night, mainly.  The CSSS has also
  requested the following events in the near future: A wings night, a bowling night,
  karaoke, fireworks, rock climbing, hiking, more movie nights, and a barbeque.

  Here''s a little tidbit of truth: Fuck you all.  Can''t you people organize your
  own events once in awhile? *nrrg*. This FreeCiv playing today has been the first
  ''Curtis'' time I''ve had all semester. If you want to see the fireworks, organize
  a trip to see the fireworks, tell me not to run an event that day, and *if you feel
  like it*, invite me. 


  On a side note, I''m getting quite portly- and while it''s nice to have guaranteed
  snuggles from Kristen regardless of my hideous appearance, the thought that I am
  significantly less attractive than other men makes me sigh a lot. Especially when
  friends of mine (Read: Erica) like to describe their very-sexy man-friends to me.


  If only there were some form of exercise that wasn''t mind-numbingly boring as gym-exercise
  or as competetive as an organized sport.'
