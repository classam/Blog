  Overtime doesn''t really matter when you only get paid $9/hr.


  I''m a part-time employee.

  I have a class at SFU, and ANOTHER JOB.


  Yeah, the fact that I looked like a zombie all week didn''t sit well with me.

  So, I quit. It''s just a night-job at a hotel, ''snot like it was a real job.'
