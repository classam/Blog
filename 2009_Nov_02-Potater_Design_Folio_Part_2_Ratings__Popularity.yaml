content: ! "It's simple enough - if people care enough to discuss something, that
  thing must be interesting.  It may not be 'popular', but it is at least interesting.
  \ So, instead of asking users to tell us whether they 'like' or 'dislike' something,
  we will simply use 'weight of metadata' as a measure of importance.  \n\nThus, the
  most 'interesting' metadata chunk is the one with the most countable instances of
  somebody adding-to or updating that metadata- The most interesting URI is the one
  with the most comments, and the most 'interesting' comment is the one with the largest
  tree of replies and sub-replies. \n\n<strong> But won't that steamroll into a few
  URIs or comment trees getting the most attention, while other, also-interesting
  comments or comment trees get the least? </strong>\n\nYes. Yes it will. It certainly
  punishes \"new content\". But most popularity systems do. That's why there's a difference
  between 'hot' (which is a function of popularity vs. time) and simply 'popular'
  (which is a function of overall popularity.) \n\n<strong>Won't people game the system
  by creating huge chains of nonsense comments to boost their rank? </strong>\n\nWe
  can adjust weight by 'number of different users' and 'amount of content' to try
  to adjust for this.  I'd imagine.  Getting the system right will require care, and
  attention, a social contract (\"Do not respond to trolls or 'first's\"), and some
  method of moderation.\n\n<strong>How do we stop spammers from creating bots that
  stuff clouds of nonce comments into pages, thus boosting that page's popularity?
  </strong>\n\nShut up shut up shut up. "
