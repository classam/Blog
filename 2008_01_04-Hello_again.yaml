content: ! "Hello, again, assorted readers!\n\n*crickets*\n\nReaders?\n\nAre any of
  you still out there? \n\nDamn, leave for a few weeks and the whole internet leaves
  with you.  Well, I'm back! The semester has begun and I'm once again committing
  to a ridiculous schedule, so as to entertain you with posts, tutorials, clowning
  about with pies, <a title=\"Clowning about with pies\" href=\"http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-clown-about-with-custard-pies\">hilarious
  links</a>, food and beverages, and the ever-popular 'etcetera'.\n\nAnd for the afore-promised
  hilarious link, we have the Merrill-Howard-Kalin show! <a href=\"http://www.boreme.com/boreme/funny-2007/merrill-howard-kalin-p1.php\">Who
  said that the mentally retarded couldn't host a wicked awesome cooking show?</a>
  \ Automatically, by watching the show and laughing, you become a horrible person-
  but that's okay.  You only have a few more days to catch this one before it gets
  taken off the internet (It's already been cleared off 'The Tube') so... take this
  opportunity to chuckle at those less fortunate than yourself.\n\nToodly pip, readers,
  and away!"
