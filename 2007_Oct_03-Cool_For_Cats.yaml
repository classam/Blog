  Image recognition is a tricky task, and one that computers tend to suck at.  One
  clever fellow found a way around this by severely restricting the problem space
  (It''s just dealing with black-on-white, it''s recognizing a shape that remains
  fairly constant).. but that doesn''t stop <a href="http://www.quantumpicture.com/Flo_Control/flo_control.htm">this</a>
  from being a super-cool thing to do. The DIY spirit is a good thing!


  Of course, if I were to set up something similar, I''d forego the image-checking
  process and just tell it to keep the door shut one out of ten times, then see how
  long it takes for the cat to adapt to the door-that-might-not-open. Also, it would
  be more fun to watch!
