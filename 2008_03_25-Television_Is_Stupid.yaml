content: ! "Okay, I'm going to admit it- I kind of like Big Bang Theory. It's a nerdy
  show. They make jokes about Black Holes and quantum thermodynamics.\n\nBut I just
  can't shake the extreme CBS-ness of the whole thing.  It's produced by Chuck Lorre,
  the mastermind behind such <em>fantastically clever</em> shows as Two and a Half
  Men, Dharma and Greg, Grace Under Fire and Roseanne. \n\nI'd like to point out that
  Grace Under Fire is actually a show about a girl named Grace.  That is an <strong>extremely</strong>
  clever pun, and I am blown away by the cleverness of said pun. Blown away.\n\nSo,
  there's a history of shows that I don't like to watch, but I'm not going to let
  that stop me from watching a show about theoretical physicists.  And it turns out
  that it is, in fact, a clever show.  There are lots of snippy in-jokes and nods
  to nerdy stuff. \n\nBut there are still a few things that I just can't stand about
  the show- the Sitcom Problems that drive me absolutely bonkers. \n\n<strong>The
  laugh track. </strong>  I hate laugh tracks. I abhor them.  The people in these
  laugh-tracks are obviously selected from the somewhat sparse group of mentally retarded
  nitrous addicts, because there is no way that a single human being could otherwise
  keep up such a consistent level of laughter at every snide comment, awkward stare,
  deft-turn-of-phrase, or de-pantsing.  \n\nFrom a comedy standpoint it makes sense-
  comedians are known to 'work the crowd' by finding the people in the audience most
  subsceptible to their humour and targeting them.  It's not just about having funny
  material- if other people around you are laughing, you're more likely to laugh.
  There's a logical reason why these laugh-tracks are there. \n\nWhen watching a show,
  though, sometimes you just want them to turn it down a couple of notches. These
  people laugh at everything.  Knocking on a door? Hilarious.  Someone gets some cereal?
  That's a laugh riot.  The whole script is broken up by muffled giggles from an unseen
  crowd- and heaven forbid that a potentially emotional moment is driven home with
  some well-thought-out silence.  The crowd will quickly commisserate with our hero
  in a rousing \"Aaaawww\" or \"Wooooo!\". \n\nThe worst part of a laugh-track is
  that it makes the viewer feel patronized- the show doesn't feel like you're smart
  enough to know when it's done something funny.\n\n<strong>Video Games on TV</strong>-
  honestly, you have a show about nerds, how hard would it to accurately portray video-game
  playing?  It's boring, I know, but it doesn't cost you anything to depict it as
  such.  Unless you're playing a Capcom game, wildly flailing at the keyboard and/or
  controller will result in only pain, suffering, and sadness. \n\n<strong>Sitcomminess</strong>
  - Wacky situations,  static characters with easily summarized personalities, and
  wacky situations!  You can almost hear the elevator pitch for the show and the episode
  in your head while you're watching it. \"See, it's about two nerds who live next-door
  to an attractive girl.\"  \"So, one of them wants to go to a conference, and the
  other one doesn't- wackiness ensues!\"  \"The Indian guy has to deal with his parents
  trying to arrange a date for him- wackiness ensues!\" etcetera etcetera.  Yes, yes,
  you're a sitcom, we know. \n\n<strong>Nerdiness As A Negative Stereotype</strong>
  - Come on, now- I love nerdiness.  I'm a huge nerd, and proud of it. I'm intelligent,
  creative, social, and I have little-to-no upper-body strength.  But as a nerd, watching
  a show that attempts to pander to nerds, it still seems that the stereotypes are
  still all there.  Okay, I'm not going to say that the common nerd stereotypes aren't
  at least a little true- but even my most <a href=\"http://lonegamer.wordpress.com/\">stereotypical
  nerd friends</a> have a few 'normal human qualities'. (For example, Ryan plays soccer!)
  \n\nThere's a pretty clear line in Big Bang Theory between the <em>nerds</em> and
  the <em>everybody elses</em>, and it's made perfectly clear that the two aren't
  compatible in any way.  Nerds don't date attractive women, and everybody is either
  hopelessly unattractive or a Los-Angeles runway model. \n\nOkay, so I'm a pretty
  nerdy guy, but it's not like a black-or-white yes/no thing where one minute you're
  an all-American Football player and the next you're a hideous gnome arguing about
  operating system choices on IRC.  Okay, I was arguing about my operating system
  choice last night on IRC, but that doesn't count. (Shut up.) \n\nFinally, I'm going
  to say that Big Bang Theory, despite it's many flaws (many of which are just centred
  about the somewhat formulaic nature of the show) still has a lot of good nerd-content,
  some clever in-jokes, and a <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/projects/Barenaked%20Ladies%20-%20Big%20Bang%20Theory.mp3\">
  catchy theme song</a> by the Barenaked Ladies.  Yeah, yeah, I'll <a href=\"http://www.torrentz.com/search?q=Big+Bang+Theory\">torrent</a>
  the next episode when it comes out. "
