content: ! "So, recently, I attended a presentation by Will Wright- at the Vancouver
  Art Gallery. It's part of the KRAZY! series that they're doing right now, and as
  an employee of Electronic Arts, I managed to nab some time off to attend. \n\nIf
  you don't know who Will Wright is, I'm not entirely sure why you're reading my blog-
  perhaps you're a family member?  Will Wright is the thin, nerdy-looking fellow responsible
  for designing such games as SimCity, the Sims, and the critically acclaimed SimTower.
  \n\nOkay, maybe that last one wasn't his crowning achievement, but it was a pretty
  solid game.\n\nNow, he's working on Spore, a new game featuring.. uh.. well, it's
  hard to describe, but it looks pretty sweet.\n\nWhen he stood in front of the group,
  he said that given the small group, he'd rather have a Q&A session than deliver
  a presentation.  Prompted for a question, we started with the following:\n \nAs
  an important caveat, every word of this is horribly mangled and paraphrased, by
  me.\n\n<h3>What would be your advice for people who want to get into a position
  to drive creative growth?</h3>\n\nIt's definitely harder now than when he started.
  \ Games have teams of over 100 people, and if you want to be on the creative side,
  you need to be able to effectively sell your ideas.\n\nGiven that, not every game
  has to be a gigantic $50-million effort- cel-phone games, indie games, online flash
  games, even Xbox Arcade games have a much lower barrier to entry than traditional
  console games.\n\nA good way to work is with quick prototypes.  He often uses targeted
  prototypes- no more than a week of work for a talented coder- to help him explore
  one aspect of gameplay.  It also allows the team to go through little miniature
  production cycles- design, production, and testing, all within one week. \n\nAs
  a creative person trying to sell people on your ideas, it's super-important to be
  able to program.  If you have a lot of little prototypes, you can impress people
  and it gives you a grasp of what's fun. \n\nAs an anecdote- originally, The Sims
  was a game about home architecture. It was more about designing a house than living
  in it.  At some point, some engineers prototyped a group of people to wander about
  in the house, 'judging' how good the architecture was by living in it.  It turns
  out, this group of people was a lot more fun to play with than the house itself.
  \n\n<h3> Are games getting too big? </h3>\n\nIt's true, nobody's willing to drop
  $30 million dollars on an unproven idea.  Most of the innovation in the industry
  comes from small groups of students- 4 to 5 students from Digital Arts institutions
  or Digipen.  (As an editorial note, a small group of Digipen students wrote \"Narbacular
  Drop\", which became the basis for the fairly well-known game \"Portal\")\n\nWith
  services like Xbox live out there, how do we get people back to paying 5 bucks for
  a game that a small group has put together- and how can we get back to a shareware
  model where people try a lot of inexpensive games?\n\n<h3> What is your perception
  of educating game designers? </h3>\n\nIn a lot of industries, the structure has
  a lot of apprentices working for years and years under a master.  As a chairmaker,
  you'll build a thousand chairs before you get to go through the process required
  to call yourself a master.  The interesting thing is, though, that in fields like
  that, you'll actually build a product hundreds of times before you learn any theory
  about it.\n\nIn the University model, you learn all of the theory before you build
  a single thing.  You don't get to learn from failure because so much of what you
  learn is designed to insulate you from failure.\n\nWill Wright is not entirely sure
  whether this is good or bad- maybe good- you have less design-by-failure, and the
  system is producing a lot of great interns.\n\n<h3>Can you think of some examples
  of games that have done well on multiple platforms? </h3>\n\nPart of this is to
  step away from the game and look at the franchise.  We're in the entertainment industry
  now more than the 'game' industry.  \n\nImagine Grand Theft Auto 4 on a cel-phone-
  it wouldn't be very good, would it.  Once you treat a game more like a franchise
  than a specific game, you can start taking advantage of the individual qualities
  of each platform.\n\nImagine Spore as a musical- or a television show.  There aren't
  a lot of good science shows for adults, maybe the Spore franchise could fill that
  niche.\n\nHow would you make a Star Trek cel-phone game? \n\nThe metagame outside
  of a game is also rich with opportunity.  See Lost as an example- a lot of additional
  content for the show was provided online. \n\n<h3> How do you come up with game
  ideas? </h3>\n\nMake a tonne of games.\n\nIf you're not obsessed with the topic,
  don't even bother.\n\nPick a topic- obsess about that topic. Read everything that
  you can get your hands on.  Then try to find some way to share that topic with others.\n\nDiscuss
  it with everybody.  You start to develop a really great pitch.\n\nThe fun part about
  the game is the mental model that the player develops-  This starts when the game
  is first pitched to the player- the very first time they hear about it, they start
  developing a mental model of the game (\"Butterfly Combat\"), and if it sounds fun,
  they'll be more likely to pick up the box and try to expand their mental model (\"With
  realistic finishing moves\").\n\nThe game has to be fun on the box, and in the imagination,
  for people to buy it. \n\n<h3>When you're so passionate about a game, when do you
  stop designing and start building?</h3>\n\nFor Spore, at least 200 prototypes were
  created.  About 20-30 of them actually ended up in the game. \n\nGames often fail
  because there's too much in them, as opposed to leaving too much out.  If the makers
  of the game were to just polish one or two of the provided game mechanics instead
  of trying to nail them all, they'd probably do a lot better.\n\nPlaytesting is huge.
  \ People tend to fail visibily and usefully when they're trying to play a game.
  \ It's good to test with new people all of the time, too- people who have been playing
  the game for a while start to get used to the bits that are confusing and work around
  them.\n\n<h3> How do you balance learning new things and adding new features with
  maintaining simplicity? </h3>\n\nIn a series, you have to keep people who enjoyed
  the last game entertained without alienating new players.  Think of the hardcore
  FPS market- it's easy for an FPS player to pick up a new game, but it's pretty closed
  off to new players. \n\nSimCity 4 was super popular with hardcore SimCity players,
  but it had so many features that it was hard for most people to figure out what
  they were supposed to be doing with it.\n\nA lot of what \"fun\" is is problem solving
  and challenge.  Easy is boring, hard is frustrating, but just enough challenge is
  fun.  \n\nDynamic Difficulty Adjustment is working to help address this- but players
  don't always like it if the game seems to get easier or harder based on their performance.
  \ \n\nSpore leans on player-created content and tries to learn from the way that
  you play. \n\n<h3> What games are you playing right now? </h3>\n\nLots of Grand
  Theft Auto 4.\n\nGTA has a lot of very simple systems- simple physics, a simple
  behavioral model for pedestrians, simple weather- but the interaction between these
  simple systems creates a complex and well-crafted system.\n\nAlso, lots of Advance
  Wars for the DS.  \n\n<h3> How do you feel about being <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51SdzzGn7Pw\">included
  in games?</a> </h3>\n\nIt's fun!  Will Wright got to meet the Simpsons' writers.
  \ Apparently, his voice became a bit hoarse from all of the evil cackling that he
  had to do. \n\n<h3>MMO stuff is becoming very big- do games have to go this way
  to survive? </h3>\n\nPersistent worlds, like World of Warcraft, aren't exactly the
  equivalent of social spaces like Facebook.\n\nPeople are starting to see virtual
  landscapes or Facebook pages as part of the real world.  \n\nWhile World of Warcraft
  has expanded out of the single player experience to encompass all of your friends,
  Wii gaming has expanded to include a whole room of players, out from the screen.
  \n\nSpore has an asynchronous form of collaboration- your world is populated by
  creatures and creations from other people's games. \n\nThink about goldfarming-
  online economies are interesting.  It turns out, the hourly wage for playing World
  of Warcraft is equal to the average hourly wage of Bulgaria (unsourced, I suppose).\n\n<h3>
  How has your education affected your games? </h3>\n\nWill Wright never finished
  a degree- instead, he learned a bit of everything.  He said that the biggest influence
  on his development was a Montessori school that he attended when he was younger.
  \ \n\nThe style of a Montessori school is that children learn more effectively through
  self-directed play than through rote memorization. \n\nA computer with an internet
  connection, these days, is the equivalent of having the entire Library of Congress
  at your fingertips.  The question becomes- how do we get people interested in all
  of this?\n\n<h3> What would you say is the relationship between designing systems
  and designing 'fun'? </h3> \n\nThink about emergence- the theory of complexity arising
  out of simplicity.  An ant is a stupid little finite-state-machine, but an anthill
  is roughly as intelligent as a dog. \n\nOne thing to consider is that there are
  some things that computers do better, and some things that humans imagine better.
  \n\nIn the Sims, the Sims speak in Simlish- because the quality of procedurally
  generated speech is so low, people would get either bored or turned off with the
  things the Sims would say.  With the Sims speaking Simlish, people can imagine what
  they're saying- something that people are fantastic at. \n\nIt's also important,
  in a simulation, to manage which strings the player can pull- and how much they
  affect the game.  The player should be able to causally link actions and reactions.
  \n\nSimEarth, for example- was a fantastic simulator- but it wasn't a very good
  game.  People would accidentally melt the entire planet and they wouldn't know why.\n\nIn
  a lot of games, the failure states are more interesting than the successes.  The
  things that people get interested in are not the successes but the interesting failures.\n\n<h3>
  Procedurally Generated Music: Discuss </h3>\n\nProcedually generated music was going
  to go into Spore, but looking at some of it- well, a lot of procedurally generated
  music sucks terribly.  \n\nWill Wright apparently got Brian Eno, a fairly famous
  guy in the world of music- and in conjunction with some Spore sound engineers, they
  got excited and produced some stuff that turned out to be really neat. \n\n<h3>
  Could You Show Us Some of Your Prototypes </h3>\n\nWell, I can't really show you
  any of Will Wright's prototypes, can I?  I think the best thing, if you're curious,
  would be to watch <a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8372603330420559198&q=&hl=en\">Will
  Wright show off some of Spore.</a> \n\n<strong> Edit: Apparently, someone posted
  a link to this page at the <a href=\"http://www.gamingsteve.com/blab/index.php?topic=12497.0\">GamingSteve.com
  forums</a>- Hi, guys, thanks for visiting- at which point it was mentioned that
  the clip I'm linking to vis-a-vis Spore is a decent example of 'prototypes', but
  as for actual gameplay, it's a bit old. So.. keep that in mind. </strong>"
