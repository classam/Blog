content: ! "Some lecturers are just better than others.  They tend to be older, more
  experienced lecturers who have been teaching the same course for some time. And
  almost all of them write their notes directly on the whiteboard, blackboard, or
  overhead projector. \n\nIn fact, one thing that students (at least in my group of
  friends) studiously avoid are professors who lean too heavily on PowerPoint. But
  why? Why do written notes outperform PowerPoint lectures so often?\n\n<strong>1.
  Writing Is Hard, Slow, and Boring</strong>\n\nLaboriously hand-copying down every
  word of the lecture is quite possibly the most mind-numbing thing in the universe.
  \n\nWhat's the benefit to that? If anything, it should slow the class down, right?
  \ \n\nWrong! Professors who write down their content tend to deliver their notes
  in a highly streamlined manner.  Thanks to the difficulty of writing everything
  down, a couple of paragraphs on a topic might be condensed down to a few words on
  that same topic- or maybe just some headlines and definitions.  \n\nWhat this means
  is that, as a note-taker, you're copying down a simple, concise summary of the most
  important points of the lecture, occasionally scribbling down something important
  or difficult along the edges.  \n\nNow here's the part where the cleverer elements
  of our audience might point out that an effective Powerpoint presentation \nis exactly
  the same thing- a simple, concise summary of the lecture, just without the added
  'writing it down on the board' \ntime.  And that's true, ideally.  Powerpoint, however,
  like Communism or the GOTO statement, is good in theory but tends to be misused
  in practice.  It's very easy to add words to a Powerpoint slide, and it doesn't
  add any extra time to the lecture- in fact, the more information on a slide, the
  less that the poor presenter has to commit to memory.  \n\nAs time passes, a Powerpoint
  Presentation will grow- more information will creep in along the edges and the slides
  will \nbloat in size and complexity. Written presentations, however, tend to become
  more minimal and concise over time, as in the name of efficiency the parts that
  are written on the board become the smallest nuggets of information that the professor
  can justify writing down. \n\n<strong>2. Students Want A Copy Of The Slides </strong>\n\nWhat?
  You're giving the slides to students?  This'll save us some writing time, but at
  what cost?\n\nOkay, I'll admit- a lot of students aren't verbal learners. It's tough
  for them to process the information as the professor goes on and on about this that
  and the other thing- and in those cases, a written copy of the lecture can be a
  godsend. \n\nBut in order for the slides to be useful for that purpose, the slides
  have to contain the entire lecture in a detailed fashion- which renders them almost
  entirely useless for their main purpose as a lecture aid. \n\nEven if the slides
  are concise, well-prepared point-form documents, students tend to listen less when
  they have the safety net of a 'pre-prepared' set of notes.  For me, the very act
  of writing down a note further cements it in my memory.  \n\nExtra-long slides are
  all but impossible to copy down. There's a reason we take notes in class, and it's
  not simply because we need further reading materials for later.  \n\n<strong>3.
  It's Read OR Listen, Not Both </strong>\n\nSo, my first two points mostly revolved
  around how Powerpoint slides increase the bloat of the notes that you see while
  you're in the lecture.  Why is it important that the notes stay streamlined?\n\nWell,
  first of all, when a professor speaks and presents a PowerPoint slide, you are presented
  with two different sources of input.  Should you be listening to the professor,
  or reading what's on the slide? It's not possible to do both.  Sometimes, the professor
  will read exactly what's on the slide, word for word, which is monotonous for the
  fast readers in the class, who will then spend most of their class nervously tapping
  their pencils, waiting for the next slide. \n\nAn important part of the lecture
  is summarizing- selectively determining what the important bits of information are
  for later recall. While it's possible to do this when presented with a solid wall
  of information, it's much easier when the professor outlines what the important
  bits are. \n\n<strong>4. Professors Aren't Designers </strong>\n\nA big portion
  of my stepmother's job is to prepare PowerPoint slides.  Smart co-workers know to
  offload the task of preparing slides to her because she knows how to make them look
  professional and smooth, and keep the slides concise and effective. \n\nMany professors
  ignore even the most simple laws of PowerPoint design- Slides absolutely MUST have
  high contrast, and big, easy to read words.  I've seen lots of slides with tiny
  letters on a background that's almost the same colour- so the slides are almost
  impossible to read.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, the amount of visual flair that's
  required for a lecture is quite easily \"Zero\". Big black letters on a big white
  background are all you need. \n\n<strong>5. Professors Can't Write As Fast As They
  Can Talk </strong>\n\nI don't know about you, but I've had a number of professors
  who've gone either much too fast or <a title=\"Not that I'm complaining.\" href=\"http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~stevenp/\">interrupted
  the lecture to go on a 20-minute segue about how they are smarter than everybody
  in the known universe, then complained about not being able to smoke in class</a>.\n\nOkay,
  written notes may not be able to guard a class against the sudden-offshoot-off-topic-lecture,
  but it can pace a professor who is just going too fast.  There's quite fortunately
  a natural limit to how fast one can write notes down.\n\n<strong>6. Memorization
  </strong>\n\nProfessors who are tossing written notes out there almost always have
  their lectures memorized.  I mean, while they have to have the lectures at least
  a bit memorized to be able to lecture at all, these professors have their lectures
  down pat- perhaps one of the biggest arguments I've been able to find for professors
  writing their notes down while they lecture is that <em>even the professors themselves</em>
  seem to have an easier time remembering the content of the lectures.\n\nAnd memorized
  lectures? Well, they're smoother, clearer, more practiced, and they have better
  pace. Glory. \n\n<strong>7. On-The-Fly Diagrams </strong>\n\nDiagrams in PowerPoint
  suffer the same problems as the notes in PowerPoint do- they are too complex, too
  fast.  While hand-drawn diagrams tend to be much simpler and more cursory, that
  also means that identifying the important concept in said diagrams is much, much
  easier.  A fantastic way to direct attention around a diagram is simply <em>not</em>
  to present the information that you want to show until you need to. \n\nOh, this
  is possible with PowerPoint- it's just more difficult and time-consuming.\n\nThe
  other big benefit of the written approach here is that when a professor wants to
  illustrate a difficult point- even if she didn't have a prepared slide- creating
  an impromptu diagram is as easy as pie.  She can even dynamically generate diagrams
  on-the-fly in response to the questions of students! Cool, huh?\n\n<strong> Objection!
  </strong>\n\nA good PowerPoint lecture can still beat the pants off of a rambling,
  off-the-cuff impromptu lecture without notes. In fact, a good PowerPoint lecture
  can beat the pants off of a lecture with written notes, especially if the professor
  writing the notes has a tendency to scrawl whole paragraphs in a language that (despite
  the professor's claims otherwise) looks like some obscure admixture of Cyrillic
  and Kanji.\n\nA good professor can make just about any lecturing style work. What
  I'm saying that professors who write their notes down are <em>more likely</em> to
  deliver a strong lecture.\n\n<strong> And Now For Something Completely Different
  </strong>\n\nJust because written notes are a strong option, doesn't mean you can't
  use a laptop in your presentations.  There are still quite a few uses for laptops
  in a lecture environment. \n\n<strong>1. Media </strong>\n\nFirst and foremost,
  pictures, videos, and music are nary impossible to deliver in a written lecture,
  unless you're a spectacularly talented live performer or an exceptionally fast artist.
  \ \n\nJust.. please be able to find it when you need it. \n\nPlease. \n\nMaybe keep
  a folder open, with a clearly marked name (\"CMPT 999\") in a place where you can
  easily find it (On your Desktop) and a backup online if necessary. Mark your media,
  in order of presentation and by name. (\" 1 - Picture Of Tom Sellack.png,   2 -
  Beethoven's Tenth.mp3...\"). \n\n<strong>2. The Word </strong>\n\nA really effective
  way to write things down for the class is available as one of Windows' least used
  utilities- good ol' Notepad.  Open it up, find the \"Format\" bar and set your text
  size to \"Enormous\" (That's 48pt or higher). Maximize the window and you have a
  way to toss your written notes up on a very big screen.\n\nAs an aside, when I was
  a Teacher's Assistant for an intro-level 'Teamwork And Communications' course, I
  would occasionally toss up Notepad in big-letter-mode behind the professor's head
  as she lectured, featuring snarky comments a-la Stephen Colbert's \"The Word\" while
  she talked.  Between that and my attempts to fail every student who couldn't write
  English at a Grade 12 level, I didn't get the job again next semester. (In the market
  for an Undergrad TA for a lower level CMPT course? Call me!)\n\n<strong>3. Print
  Out All Of Your PowerPoint Slides Onto Transparencies, Then Write On Them </strong>\n\nI'm
  just joking. Never, ever do this.  Just take my word for it, it's awkward. "
