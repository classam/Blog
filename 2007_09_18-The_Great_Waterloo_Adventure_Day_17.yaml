  />\n\nI've taken that computer I bought, plugged in 250 gigabytes of memory and
  my portable hard drive (another 250 gigabytes of memory) to form a handy <a title=\"Wikipedia:
  Samba\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_%28software%29\">SAMBA</a> network
  share containing tonnes of movies and music and what-have-you.\n\nIt's running <a
  title=\"Ubuntu Linux\" href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu Linux</a>.  It's connected
  to Mike's Huge Television and some Speakers, so we can use it to watch or listen
  to digital content.  It has a headset and Skype, so I can use it to<a title=\"Almost
  free\" href=\"http://www.skype.com/products/skypeout/\"> call home for free</a>.
  It has a keyboard and mouse on the coffee table, so I can surf the internet or chat
  with friends from the couch.\n\nBased on these many very useful features, I'm curious
  why everybody doesn't have a networked fileserver sitting next to their television.
  \ It's not even running anything fancy like MythTV and it's still the most useful
  thing in the known planet.\n\nIf I can just get Ubuntu to deal with gamepads reasonably,
  I'll be able to use it to play Super Nintendo games. Woo!   \n\nBeing that we don't
  have television, our source of entertainment tends to be downloaded internet content.
  \ I've been watching a lot of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Eats\">Good
  Eats</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Chef\">Iron Chef</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_High\">Clone
  High</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrubs_%28TV_series%29\">Scrubs</a>,
  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigun\">Trigun</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Chicken\">Robot
  Chicken</a>.  \n\nOn a side note, for being a part of creating Clone High, Spin
  City, and Scrubs, Bill Lawrence wins. \n\nThe \"Good Eats\" episodes on coffee and
  tea were especially invigorating.  While tea has less caffeine than coffee, it also
  comes with chemicals that make that smaller amount of caffeine last longer.  It's
  a milder, longer buzz.  \"Orange Pekoe\" does not imply any orange flavor- it's
  just a higher-quality size of black tea leaves. \"Earl Gray\" is just black tea
  leaves and bergamot.  Loose-leaf tea is almost always better than tea-bag tea, which
  tends to contain smaller units of tea (which taste bitter). You should never poke
  tea-bags.  Tea should be stored in an airtight container. So should coffee- but
  because coffee releases carbon dioxide, it needs to be vented now and then.  If
  you make your coffee with insufficient grounds, it won't be weak- it will be bitter.
  \ The measurements are 1 teaspoon of tea leaves to one cup of tea, and 2 tablespoons
  of beans for one cup of coffee. That's a 'cup' cup, not a mug, which usually holds
  about 2 cups worth.  Italian coffees (espresso) taste darker because they're roasted
  longer- that's also why they're lower in caffeine.  For the most caffeinated and
  flavorful coffees, look for light roasts- whereas dark roasts tend to have a richer,
  darker, stronger flavor and less caffeine.\n\nI'm starting to feel vegetable deprived.
  \ My fruit and vegetable intake has been pretty steady, but it's also been almost
  entirely tomatoes, apples, and orange juice, with the occasional break for some
  lettuce.  My next trip to Sobey's is going to involve more vegetabling.\n\nAt work,
  I told my boss that I didn't want to stick around for another 4 months after this
  semester- as a starter, I miss my family, and as a much bigger issue, working on
  nothing but PHP during co-ops will lead to my becoming a PHP developer, which is
  the last thing in the universe that I want.  \n\nHe asked if I would stay for a
  non-PHP development job, and I said that I probably would.  It doesn't matter whether
  it's Java, Java, or Java (it's RIM, it's probably going to be Java), it's something
  to put on my resume that's solidly applications-level programming instead of web-programming.
  (That line gets progressively thinner every year)  I like the RIM atmosphere, the
  ridiculous pay, and the short commute.  Working for a second term would also mean
  more monies- a raise!\n\nSo now they're keeping their eyes out for development jobs
  in STS. \n\nAs for the software that I'm actually working on, it doesn't look like
  I've done anything, really.  I've written classes to abstract away database functionality,
  moved the headers and footers that were constant for every page in the site into
  their own file, cleaned out a few bugs, introduced some automated testing, split
  the repository into testing and release branches, learned some Perforce, laid down
  a quick script to automate some common repository tasks, restructured large parts
  of the main program (going from PHP-script to vaguely-modular-PHP-app, and dropping
  as much as 70% of the file in the case of some files), replaced some SQL statements
  with better SQL statements, and fixed a big-joe's-trailer-truck of a bug.\n\nThe
  only thing out of that list that's actually a visible result of my work, however,
  is the big bugfix. Everything else is just behind the scenes.  I could be snorting
  cocaine for all my boss knows. (I'm not)\n\nSo, I hope I get to add something new
  and visible to the system, soon. I don't even know if the thing I'm building has
  any users. \n\nNow that I spend all of my time at home or at work, my BlackBerry
  ( A model <a href=\"http://na.blackberry.com/eng/devices/device-detail.jsp?navId=H0,C63,P73\">8700r
  </a>) goes largely unused.  Clearly I need to spend more time roaming about Waterloo,
  although I haven't quite pegged down what I should be doing out there. \n\nI did
  go out today, though. I bought some <a href=\"http://www.skullcandy.com/shop/smokinbuds-p-10.html?zenid=1eb26cc5cb9ee2de8883ae1a891f80ea\">Skullcandy
  Smokin' Buds</a> earphones, which do a much better job of eliminating outside sound
  and playing clean sound than both my $5 work headphones and my half-broken iPod
  headphones.  Heck, they even sound better than my laptop speakers. \n"
