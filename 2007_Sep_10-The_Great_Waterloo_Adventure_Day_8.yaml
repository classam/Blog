  />\n\nWell, my weekend was pretty uneventful.\n\nOn Friday, I went out to Molly
  Bloom's Irish Pub with Mike and some of his friends.  I discovered that Mike's female
  friend.. I think a girlfriend of one of Mike's friends or something.. well, she's
  easily poked vis-a-vis her Polish ancestry.\n\n\"Hey? How many Germans does it take
  to invade Poland?\"\n\"Just one- to forget to leave the parking brake off on his
  tank. Whoops! Invaded Poland!\"\n\nEheh heh. Bad jokes are fun. I had a Strongbow
  for way too much money, and we sat around listening to the kinda-crappy live music
  and trying to hold a conversation at the top of our lungs. \n\nMike said, \"The
  next thing that these guys are going to play is 'Wonderwall' by Oasis.\", and I
  didn't believe him. \"Really?\" \"Yeah, whatever bar I'm in, the live band always
  plays Wonderwall.\"\n\nThe next song was \"500 Miles\", by the Proclaimers, and
  I was disappointed.. until the band played their next song, which was Wonderwall.
  Good call, Mike!\n\nAs a caveat, here, Waterloo is full of things called \"Beer
  Stores\".  You walk right in and get a selection of beers that would knock your
  socks off, all cheap and cold.  Unfortunately, that's *all* that the beer store
  carries. No ciders. No hard liquors. Just beer.  \n\nSaturday was my \"Do Nothing\"
  day.  \n\nWe finally got hooked up with The Internets, and I had a chance to call
  Kristen and Mom.  It's nice to talk to people back home!  I couldn't get a hold
  of Dad or Tracy right away, but I ended up calling them on Sunday.  I'm using SkypeOut
  Unlimited right now, which gives me unlimited long-distance calls to Canada or the
  United States, for $29.95/yr. That's per-year, not per-month. Inexpensive! The quality
  of the calls has been pretty good so far.\n\nWe also met our new roommate, Ben.
  \ He's actually not a RIM employee, but a 4th year Math Major at the University
  of Waterloo.  He's very quiet, so far, and he seems to be the same kind of nerdy
  as the rest of us, so things look good.\n\nHaving completed those onerous tasks,
  I spent the remainder of the day on the couch, playing Super Paper Mario. \n\nI
  managed to eat some of that pasta sauce I made.  Let me tell you, any bad things
  I might have said about that sauce in the past, I take back. It was delicious- even
  better than the first one I made.  Those who forget the pasta are condemned to reheat
  it.  I'm using whole-wheat noodles, because I lubs them, and salting the water like
  there's no tomorrow. I'm not sure who said it, but \"The noodles that you boil pasta
  in should be as salty as the Mediterranean\". It really does add a lot of flavor
  to the noodles. Mmm.\n\nSunday was a combo day.  A nice, long shower and a trip
  to the supermarket really rounded out the day.  I picked up fruit, vegetables, yogourt,
  juice, milk, chocolate milk, taco powder, salsa, a little bit of everything.  Then,
  home, laundry, and more Super Paper Mario.  I ended up finishing the game at about
  2:30 in the morning. Ha! Success!\n\nSo, today I'm back at work.  I spent the morning
  removing a variable from the entire codebase that was irritating me: $BasePath,
  which was designed to find a directory right under the base directory... except
  it frequently failed and was a bit on the ugly, terrible side.  I replaced just
  about every instance of $BasePath with ../ , making my life considerably easier
  and the code significantly less ugly.  On top of that, the 4-part calculation required
  to generate $BasePath was just copy/pasted into every single page. *shudder*.\n\nAnd
  this code is pretty ugly.  It's not divided in any reasonable way into HTML, PHP,
  or Database calls- it's just all smooshed together in one hugely long script that
  manages to get the job done.  There are about 5 functions, most of which can be
  traced back to the last guy's \"Refactoring of the code\". \n\nRight now, I'm pulling
  all of the database calls out of the script and putting them in classes where they
  belong. More needs to be done, though- so much more.  I haven't even eaten lunch,
  yet- I'm just so absorbed in the puzzle of making this codebase less ugly. \n\nIt's
  frustrating, but fun.  Cleaning, organizing, and architecturing code is (surprisingly)
  something I like! Go team OCD! \n\nSee you all tomorrow!"
