content: ! "Well, I'm finally done my 376 final assignment.\n\nIt was a long haul.
  \ After a conversation with the professor, it was decided that I probably couldn't
  use my original topic, Procrastination, for the final assignment. This was really
  irritating, because the whole paper was <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/projects/Procrastinate.pdf\">almost
  done</a> (pdf), darn-it! \n\nSo instead, I decided to write on the incredibly dry
  topic of setting up a LAMP server.  Of course, the actual process of setting up
  a LAMP server is something that only takes about 10 minutes and a copy of Ubuntu
  Server Edition. So I padded it out by calling it the process of web development
  with a LAMP server, giving a complete overview of all of the things one would need
  to get started developing web-applications, from the server-set-up to MySQL to PHP
  coding.  Of course, if this was an exhaustive overview, it would certainly go over
  the 10-page limit, so it ends up being somewhat.. brief. Extremely brief, really.\n\nAh,
  well, nonetheless- here it is: <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/projects/SettingUpAServerWithAStackOfLamps.pdf\">Setting
  Up A Server With A Stack of Lamps</a> (pdf) .\n\n"
