content: ! "So, over the course of the past day or so, I've purchased jPod, read it,
  downloaded the show, and watched the first couple of episodes.\n\nIt manages to
  capture the insanity of Vancouver and the inanity of tech work.  Yeah, everybody
  knows at least one person who's worked on-with-or-around a grow-op.  Those of us
  in the tech industry *are* all borderline aspies- the sort of person who would read
  a book, then <a href=\"http://www.torrentz.com/search?q=jpod\">download</a> a show,
  then get irritated at the differences between the two despite the high quality of
  both. \n\nThe Neotronic Arts logo is hilarious. The guy who plays Steve in the T.V.
  show totally captures a marketing guy I worked with at one of the companies I've
  worked at. (At least I think he was marketing- I never really knew.) \n\nThe show
  isn't as bleak as the book. Which I like, because the book hit a bit close to home.
  \ If you read it, it might hit you there, too.  The show doesn't capture office-life
  quite so well, though. Toss-up. \n\nAnd the show has some seriously hilarious moments.
