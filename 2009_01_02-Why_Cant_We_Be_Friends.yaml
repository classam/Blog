content: ! "So, reddit was fighting over consoles versus PC's, and.. well.. honestly,
  I'm just tired of seeing this argument. It's like Mac guys and PC guys having it
  out- yeah, you have lots of valid points, but so does the other guy.\n\nIf you're
  a PC guy, there are lots of good reasons to be- you've got...\n\n<ul> \n<li> Steam,
  <small>with it's inexplicably good deals and strong community.</small></li>\n<li>
  Pirated games, <small>that will give your computer the digital equivalent of HIV.</small></li>\n<li>
  keyboard & mouse, <small>all the better for FPS, RTS, MMO and Strategy games. </small></li>\n<li>
  free online play, <small>damn you, Microsoft, </small> </li>\n<li> laptop-style
  portability, <small>if you like casual games or knee-breakingly heavy laptops</small></li>\n<li>
  a potentially seamless experience, <small>if you're wealthy, smart, and lucky.</small>
  </li>\n<li> a machine for all of your other computering needs, <small>Excel, porn,
  programming, porn, reddit, porn. </small> </li>\n</ul>\n\nWhereas, if you're a console
  guy, you've got...\n<ul>\n<li> Party games, <small>for those three dicks at the
  party who are good at Rock Band. </small> </li>\n<li> The gamepad, <small>for fighting,
  sports, racing, and lots of other games. </small> </li>\n<li> Ease-of-setup and
  use, <small>red ring of death? NOOOO! </small> </li>\n<li> The couch and T.V., <small>which
  you probably already spent tonnes of money on. Fatty. </small> </li> \n<li> Variety,
  <small>'cause there are more console games than P.C. games. </small> </li>\n</ul>\n\nThey
  have their flaws, too, but nothing horrifying.\n\nI don't really see the point of
  being a zealot either way- go with whatever floats your nubbins, or- if you can't
  choose- go with both.  (That works for your choice of OS, too.) \n"
