  lecture in a while.  Tech Writing, while interesting at times, has not been an urgent
  class where lots of important facts are imparted. Things have come up.  \n\nThis
  Wednesday (today), for example, I had to meet with Stella Atkins about some marking-
  in order to have my Thursday (Valentine's Day) free to spend with Kristen. We're
  going to have breakfast, go to the aquarium, make some cashew-chicken-stir-fry,
  and go to a <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=360\">Valentine's Day Party</a>
  tomorrow.  These things are more important to me than 376. (Addendum: While Christians
  are super-creepy when they're preachin', when they're having parties they're good
  folk. )\n\nOn Friday? I have to be at a Tea Club & Robotics Society Meeting.  I
  have to go, because I have a FEVER, and the only cure is MORE ROBOTS.\n\nNext Friday?
  I have something clever planned.  Something clever and evil. (More on that tomorrow.)\n\nSo,
  I've been skipping out on 376 a lot lately.  Greg Baker tried to address the problem
  of <a href=\"http://gregbaker.ca/blog/2008/02/11/whats-376-for/\">What 376 Is For</a>-
  and while the theory is sound, the course itself so far seems a little bit light
  on content.\n\nNow, I'm not one to think that my English is perfect, beyond the
  boundaries of improvement- but meta-discourse on the topic of English is both dense
  and incredibly boring. Some far-away authorities have managed to come up with a
  codified system of rules to define both English language elements and how they can
  be effectively used.  Retrieving this knowledge in it's codified form, however,
  seems entirely beyond my limited mental faculties.  The best way to really get a
  feel for these rules would be to read a lot of well-written articles, try to write
  your own, and have someone slap you about when you're not writing things clearly
  enough.   (Of course, no University course in existence has enough manpower to accomplish
  that in 4 months with one TA.)\n\nFree-writing is a good thing and a valuable exercise.
  \ Okay. Lesson learned.  Do we really have to spend class-time on it every lecture?
  It feels like it devalues the lecture itself to spend time with a professor doing
  something that I could reasonably be doing at home, or at school, or on the bus
  on the necks of unexpected passengers. (This being why I carry a sharpie.)\n\nI
  came to 376 with a few very specific questions in mind:\n<ul>\n<li> How do I write
  effective documentation? </li>\n<li> How can I write an effective technical specification?
  </li>\n<li> How can I write effective and convincing product reviews? </li>\n<li>
  Are there other critically important technical documents that I'm not thinking of?
  </li>\n<li> How do I write those? </li> \n</ul>\n\nNow, I was hoping to have those
  questions answered- (Hoping being the operative word)- but instead I'm getting drilled
  in the fundamentals.  Now, I'm sure the best answer to each one of those questions
  is \"Write concisely and clearly\", but maybe I was hoping for a little more of
  the Software Engineering bits, too.  Of course, that could get tedious, fast, as
  well.  I certainly don't envy Ted the task of putting this course together.  "
