content: ! 'So, Microsoft''s released a <a href="http://www.msdewey.com/">search engine</a>
  that takes a long time to load and an even longer time to find any sort of results.

  (At least I think it''s Microsoft. It says (C) 2006 Microsoft at the bottom)


  The kick? It has an attractive, racially neutral spokeswoman in high fidelity introducing
  your searches and commenting on your choices.


  My inner engineer is going "Oh, gads no, I want my searches finished RIGHT AWAY.
  No waiting. No irritating host chatter. There''s work that needs to be done. The
  novelty will wear off in less than an hour, then everyone''s just going to go back
  to Google."


  The Sci-Fi nerd in me says "They''ve finally done it. That''s so very awesome. It''s
  like something out of an Isaac Asimov book poorly adapted into a movie featuring
  Will Smith for some reason. Subservient Searching Girl. Neat."'
