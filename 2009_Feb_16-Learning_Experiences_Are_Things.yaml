content: ! "Kristen's trying to put together lesson plans for Grade 7 students.  She
  wants to do more things with techmology.\n\nShe wanted to start with Flash, but
  it's not installed in the labs at her school- and it's very, very expensive. \n\nMy
  suggestion of 'hit them again and again with plywood' was not well recieved.\n\nShe's
  not quite tech savvy enough to introduce them to programming basics- although if
  we found something suitable, I might be able to get HER through some of the basics.
  (I looked at Phrogram, and once again, it was expensive- although an order of magnitude
  less expensive than Flash)\n\nIt has to be free, and at least moderately educational.
  \ Looking to push your own values on a generation of kids? Now's your chance!\n\nAny
  ideas?"
