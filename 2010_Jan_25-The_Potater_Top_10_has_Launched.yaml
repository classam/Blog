content: ! "Okay! You have to check this shit out! It is shit that is crazy! Crazy
  shit!\n\nThis Daily Top 10 that I have been writing has been so fun that I have
  launched a new website for it.  This website resides at <a href=\"http://potater.com\">potater.com</a>.
  There's also a weekend roundup there, although I composed it really quickly so it
  might be a little bit exactly-the-same-as-usual. \n\nIt's kinda late, and I'm kinda
  tired, so I'll leave off talking about the totally ridiculous way I've built potater.com
  until tomorrow. What I will say now is that it supports Atom (not RSS, fuck RSS,
  doesn't support ISO dates, haet.) \n\nAlso? Still lots of polish needs to be done.
  \ Like 'category' support, and 'crazy speed optimizations', and 'creative commons
  license', and 'picture of Gary Busey' and 'api documentation'.  More tomorrow. Now
  sleep. "
