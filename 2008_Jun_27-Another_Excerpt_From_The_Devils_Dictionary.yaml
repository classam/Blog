content: ! 'MAN, n.  An animal so lost in rapturous contemplation of what he thinks
  he is as to overlook what he indubitably ought to be.  His chief occupation is extermination
  of other animals and his own species, which, however, multiplies with such insistent
  rapidity as to infest the whole habitable earth and Canada.
