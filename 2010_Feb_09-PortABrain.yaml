  articles feature jokes that are only funny for complete and utter nerds. You know,
  like me. </em>\n\nI love me some old science-fiction, but sometimes there's a little
  bit of the ol' \"<a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn\">Missed
  the mark</a>\" when predicting things far in the future. \n\nFor example, in 1990's
  \"Phule's Company\", a book set so far in the future that mankind covers all of
  observable space...\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The Port-A-Brain computer system was designed
  to be the ultimate in pocket computers.  Its main strength was that it enabled the
  user to tap into nearly any database or library in the settled worlds, place an
  order with most business above a one-store retail level, or communicate directly
  with or leave messages for any business which utilized any form of computerized
  telecommunications, all without so much as plugging into a wall outlet or tapping
  into a phone line.  What's more the unit, complete with folding screen, was no larger
  than a paperback book.  In short, it was a triumph of high-tech microcircuitry.
  \n\n... but there was a small problem.  Each unit cost as much as a small corporation,
  placing it well out of the financial reach of the individual and all but the most
  extravagant conglomerate executive officers; and even those who could afford one
  usually contented themselves to use the cheaper modes of data access, particularly
  since their job positions were lofty enought to allow them to delegate such menial
  tasks such as research and communications to lower echelon staffers.  As such, there
  were fewer than a dozen Port-A-Brain units in actual use in the entire galaxy. \"\n</blockquote>\n\nMmm,
  <a href=\"http://www.dell.com/home/netbooks\">expensive</a>. "
