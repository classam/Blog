content: ! "Oh my god! Curtis hasn't posted for TWO WHOLE DAYS!\n\nYes, things are
  afoot. I've been hugely busy this week- \n\nSunday was a memorial for Grandma Judy.
  \n\nMonday I was so exhausted and drained from Sunday I just slept for most of the
  day. \n\nTuesday I worked on my Symbolic Computing homework (Small Lisp!) and finished
  66% of it. \n\nWednesday I went to Web Directions North (School was closed anyways),
  left before the closing keynote, and finished the last 33% of my Symbolic Computing
  homework, getting it done a mere 20 minutes before the midnight deadline.\n\nToday
  I went to Web Directions North again, all day this time, and this time I stayed
  for the whole thing- then dinner and a hosted party with unlimited free booze.\n\nI've
  had maybe 9 hours of sleep over the last two days and I am exhausted- so exhausted
  that I left the party after two-and-a-half hours, only three high-balls and a beer.
  \ Next year- and I\"m definitely going next year- I'm going to have to plan ahead,
  sleep more, and drink more than double my weight in, as <a href=\"http://antipode.ca\">Allen</a>
  termed it, \"Free Infinite Alcohol\". \n\nThere have been lots of big names, I've
  had a great time, and I have a whole whack of blog posts in mind- two 'restaurant
  reviews', one long-overdue bacon post, and a bunch of Web Directions 08 stuff-  But
  for now I just need some sleep. I'll see you all tomorrow!"
