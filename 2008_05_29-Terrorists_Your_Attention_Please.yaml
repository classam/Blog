  \n\nThe executive team responsible for <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/trailers/disney/beverlyhillschihuahua/trailer_medium.html\">Beverly
  Hills Chihuahua</a>, and any team members involved in it's production who failed
  to summarly quit or throw themselves off of a bridge in horror.\n\n<a href=\"http://kotaku.com/5011292/rip-guitar-hero-2005+2008\">The
  Guy From The Guitar Hero 'On Tour' Promo</a>, and any game that once emphasized
  the sheer <acronym title=\"It's a word because I want it to be.\">badassitude</acronym>
  of rock that is now rated E for Everyone. \n\n<a href=\"http://michaelianblack.typepad.com/blog/2008/05/some-advice-on.html\">Micheal
  Ian Black</a>.  He knows what he did.\n\nMicrosoft, for introducing Windows Vista,
