  />\n\nEverybody who's talked to me knows the disdain for which I treat 'Web 2.0'
  companies (It's right up there with 'Enterprisey' on the list of words that irritate
  me to no end).  It's a trendy buzzword-of-the-year, not to mention my pedantic obsession
  with the fact that the \"Web\" is an entity composed of the versions of all of the
  software that comprises it, so that it would more rightfully be called (Web: IPv6,
  HTTP 1.1, HTML 4, CSS 2, Apache 2, PHP 5, MySQL 5, Javascript 1.7, etc...). That's
  a bit of a mouthful, isn't it?\n\nBut, no, what Web 2.0 really means to most people
  is \"Web Bubble 2.0\".  Tonnes of companies are sprouting up, getting some venture
  capital, tossing together a business plan that violates fundamental tenets of human
  nature or financial acumen (\"Oh? It's advertising supported.\"), and hoping for
  the best.  \n\nWhy do I care? This shouldn't be a problem for any intelligent human
  being, right? These companies provide good homes for a lot of developers who need
  some paycheques or some entry-level experience, right?\n\nNo, I care because I'm
  a cranky old bastard and I hate running across websites like \"<a href=\"http://www.zango.com/\">Zango</a>\".\n\n<img

  />\n\nWhy <a href=\"http://www.zango.com/\">Zango?</a>. It's Web 2.0 down to the
  very core. It's like they've jumped on every concievable bandwagon. Their name is
  a single, incomprehensible word that sounds zippy, they're offering video content,
  it's ad-supported, they have games, and in order to view all of their content, you
  have to do something incredibly stupid. (In this case, download and install some
  software to make sure you're watchin' ads.)\n\nWhy? Why would a company in *2007*
  be stupid enough to think that people are going to download and install a piece
  of 3rd party software on their computer when all they have to do to get similar
  content without the hassle is go to, say, youTube? The content they offer is the
  same old youTube fare (\"MAN GETTING HIT IN NUTS WITH FOOTBALL! Z0MG!\") combined
  with a smidgeon of AddictingGames and the old mainstay of the AOL-using-granny's
  security problems, *SCREENSAVERS*. \n\nGRAH! \n.. I hate the internet. \n\nOkay,
  so, here's the game.. I challenge you (i.e.: Anyone reading my blog) to find some
  web companies that are just as poorly-thought-out as Zango! Go!"
