  exactly what is it that Curtis has been spending his time on? Not blogging, clearly.\n\nNo,
  I've been spending my time with Kristen, beautiful-girlfriend-o-mine.\n\nWe've been
  playing Age of Empires 2. \n\n\"Age of Empires 2 for the DS?\", those people who
  know me or Kristen will ask.\n\nNope.\n\n\"Age of Empires 2 for the Playstation
  2?\"\n\nNope Again.\n\nWe've been playing Age of Empires 2 for the PC, no expansions.\n\n\"But
  Curtis! Age of Empires 2 is from 1999! It's ancient! They've released 2 sequels
  already!\"\n\nAge of Empires 2 is both ridiculously fun AND capable of running on
  every piece of hardware built in the last 7 years.  The only problem I've had with
  it is the somewhat obscure networking required to get the game connected on a home
  network.  Age Of Empires 2 doesn't require a 256Mb Graphics Card with T&A (or whatever).
  It doesn't require a gigabyte of RAM, or 2 gigabytes of hard-drive space.  The Age
  of Empires 2 website doesn't have a section marked 'Performance Tweaks' for people
  who are having trouble playing the game at full speed. (The tweaks are as follows:
  Buy expensive things and put them in your computer.) We can play Age Of Empires
  2 on the maximum settings (200 units, Giant map, tonnes of computers) without so
  much as a hardware wink.  It's jam-packed full of strategy and explosions and trebuchets.
  \ Maybe too many trebuchets.\n\nOf course, playing the game so much almost *ALMOST*
  makes me want to commit the most common nerd social faux pas, which is as follows:\n
  \n<strong>\nYou must never, ever, talk about gaming with people who haven't just
  played the same game with you.</strong>\n\nI have a strong desire to say things
  like:\n\n<div class=\"quote\">So, we were on an island map, right? So, I sneak a
  transport full of peasants on to the back-side of her island, build a castle and
  a little base right next to Kristen's base.. and start attacking from behind.. then,
  I run out of gold on my home island. It's terrible. But to save the day, right next
  to the castle is a big pile of gold.. so I build a town hall and a gold mine, and
  protected by the castle, my peasants are mining gold right next to Kristen's base!
  </div>\n\nor \n\n<div class=\"quote\"> Man, Trebuchets really unbalance the game!
  That much siege power means that they're pretty much the only weapon you ever use
  to decimate bases, and they make walls and castles almost useless.</div>\n\nBut
  the thing is, though, nobody, nobody in the entire world, really cares what I think
  about Age of Empires 2.  It's a dead topic. It's boring to listen to. \n\nIf you're
  a nerd, you've probably felt the urge to talk about a game that you're playing with
  other people.  I'm telling you now- don't go down that road.  Any other topic, any
  topic at all, is more potentially interesting than boring your conversational partners
  with the tale of that time you totally tweaked out your Final Fantasy 6 party so
  that Locke could attack 6 times in a row, cast infinite Ultima spells, and shit
  gold.\n\nThis goes doubly for those of you trying to attract members of the opposite
  sex.  \n"
