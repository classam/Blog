content: ! "This site's theme has been updated to include more glossy, unnecessary
  features, and a new logo.\n\nIt now uses <a href=\"http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/\">sIFR</a>
  and <a href=\"http://www.jqueryui.com/home\">jQuery UI</a> to provide nice fontage
  and moving accordion-style effects. \n\nHere are some things I've learned. \n\n<h3>Twitter
  Integration is Really Easy</h3>\n\nReally, you can just drop a HTML widget in and
  style it.  You could do it RIGHT NOW. It's that easy.\n\nThe hard part is... you
  know... actually using Twitter.  I pay for text messages, so I'm not going to go
  to the trouble of setting that up - and I rarely visit Twitter in the course of
  a regular day.  Someone had a way to automatically sync Facebook status and Twitter
  status. I should learn about that thing. \n\n<h3> Too Many Cooks Spoil The Broth
  </h3>\n\nI'm worried that, between Google Analytics, sIFR, Twitter, jQuery, and
  Code Syntax Highlighting, my page is loading too many things on first-visit. Seriously,
  the overhead upon first-visiting my site can amount to as much as a second!  I'm
  going to need to look at maybe cutting down on some of the largesse.  \n\nI mean,
  technical features are the wave of the future and all, but <a href=\"http://travisbrown.ca/blog.html\">Travis's
  site</a> is written in straight-up static HTML (he does it with some sort of crazy
  homebrew macro system, or so I hear) - contains everything he's ever written, and
  it still loads faster than mine. Oh, static content, you scamp.\n\nI've got jQuery/UI
  loading from the Google Content Delivery Network (free bandwidth, right? it should
  be fast, too)- and my site doesn't suffer from a dearth of images- but thanks to
  the bulkily written Code Syntax Highlighter, jQuery, and SIFR, the first load of
  a page precaches about 17 different files on the client computer. Yikes.\n\nSome
  paring may need to be done. \n\n<h3>sIFR Doesn't Play Nice With Animations. </h3>\n\nsIFR
  is a neat idea- I'm note sure if I quite like it, yet, but being able to use Trade
  Gothic LT STD as a header font instead of ... Verdana, or Arial- well, it's a nice
  choice.\n\nThe only trouble is, introduce the sIFR text-replacement at the same
  time as the jQuery Accordion widget, and you have a mess on your hands.  After a
  bit of research on both sIFR and jQuery (\"What if I reload sIFR every time the
  Accordion changes?\") I just decided to drop sIFR from the Accordion effect. \n\n<h3>Gravatar
  is Great</h3>\n\nIn terms of amount-of-joy-delivered per unit-of-work-expended,
  Gravatar avatars have been my favourite blog add ever.  Heck, I even built a <a
  href=\"http://ikoverse.com/page/website/\">Django template-tag processor that automatically
  Gravatarizes e-mail addresses</a>. Internet API calls are fun! \n\n<h3>favico.ico
  and Little Cabooses</h3>\nI'm not sure if I should replace this site's favicon.
  \ I mean, the favicon that I'm currently using is the first one I ever put up- it
  went with the first-ever website theme. I've since replaced the theme, but I still
  like that little dude and his arrow.\n\nMy new site logo certainly does lend itself
  to favicoization. \n\nOn top of that, I still have the little Cabooses from my last
  major theme update around.  I'm not sure if I should think of them as cute reminders
  of themes past or crufty remnants of ... themes past. \n\nI suspect I should replace
  the both of them with new elements that match the site. \n\nI also have to update
  my portfolio (see about getting hired soon, ya?) ... oh, and I should include a
  link to my <a href=\"http://ikoverse.com/\">comic site</a> in there somewhere (Maybe
  in \"About Me\"?)...\n\nSo much work to do. Tell me what you think! "
