content: ! "So, I'm fiddling with my router, and I know from horrible past experiences
  that Telus requires you to register your MAC address with them, deep within their
  horrible robot mines- and you only get 2 registrations per account. Because my computer
  has the 'registered' MAC address, I have to use the router's \"Clone MAC Address\"
  function.\n\n<code>\nMAC has been coloned successfully! \n</code>\n\n\nWow! I don't
  have any idea what \"Coloning\" is, but it sounds really uncomfortable and somehow
  refreshing. The fact that my router can perform the task is quite alarming."
