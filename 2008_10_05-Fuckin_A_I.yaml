  of today building a Min-Max Backgammon-Playing Algorithm, and then a Backgammon-Evaluating
  Function that could be used to try to 'read' the board. \n\nMy more-advanced algorithm
  was able to easily trounce the professor's provided \"Random Backgammon Agent\"
  and \"Simple Backgammon Agent\".  When it played against my girlfriend, however,
  it had a strong opening game- with an almost unnatural ability to anchor points-
  but refused to push its lead and ended up losing.  It didn't help that Kristen ended
  up with a *LOT* of doubles.  \n\nThe algorithm needs some work. "
