  />\n\nAllen is a Mac Os X <del>Fanboy</del> user.  He's been to the WWDC, he's using
  a sexy little MacBook. He posts in his blog about <a title=\"10 Days Until Mac-Os
  10.5\" href=\"http://www.antipode.ca/2007/10-days-until-mac-os-x-105/\">neat features
  in the upcoming Leopard release</a>. \n\nWell, I say, boo!  \n\nWhy boo?\n\nI don't
  want to jump into the OS Holy War- I don't like Mac Os X because I'm a poor student,
  and I can't afford The Mac Tax. \n\nCompare the <a title=\"MacBook\" href=\"http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?nnmm=browse&mco=7B723640&node=home/shop_mac/family/macbook\">MacBook</a>
  with the Dell <a title=\"Inspiron 1501\" href=\"http://www1.ca.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/inspn_1501?c=ca&cs=cadhs1&l=en&s=dhs\">
  Inspiron 1501 </a>.\n\nSpec for spec, the loosely-affiliated bucket of assorted
  bargain-bin Dell parts match the MacBook.  \n\nThe Inspiron is also a bulkier contender,
  not as slick or stylish, with a lower battery life. It's just not the same all-in-one
  package that you'll get with a MacBook.  But it's also $500 cheaper.  The \"Mac
  Experience\" is, in this case, a 46% tax. \n\nSomewhere, someone's come to the decision
  that \"The Mac Experience\"- an ethereal combination of Mac Os X and shiny hardware
  design, is worth about $400. \n\nComparatively, an OEM Microsoft Windows usually
  adds about $80 to the cost of the rig, and a Ubuntu 7.10 (\"Gutsy Gibbon\") installation
  costs approximately the price of one CD-R ($.20). In fact, every CS Student at SFU
  gets a free copy of Windows XP Professional and Ubuntu 7.10 just for taking a CS
  course.\n\nI don't know about you, but I'd say a properly configured Ubuntu+Windows
  configuration can at least hold it's ground on the development battlefield. (Not
  to mention, you have the opportunity to spend a weekend custom-building a <a title=\"The
  Scott Hanselman Special\" href=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CommentView.aspx?guid=6ED8D229-2E2A-4B74-A65A-39EE6F7D4E9D\">
  Homebrew Monster </a>. Sweet.)   \n\nSo, while Mac Os X is clearly a pretty sexy
  contender, it's going to be a long time before I'm willing to voluntarily pony up
  $400 for an operating system - especially when sexy contenders like <a title=\"Ubuntu
  7.10\" href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/710tour\">Ubuntu 7.10</a>
  are around.  Maybe I'll pay the Mac Tax when I'm making a little bit more money."
