content: ! "So, every year, the Computing Science Student Society produces a \"Frosh
  Guide\" for new Computing Science students.  I remember typesetting our standard
  guide and adding batches of crazy rambling, one year.\n\nAs for \"Advice for CS
  Students\", I polled Dan, Travis, and Dovic, and <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=341\">used
  their advice</a>. The school did not appreciate Dovic's advice. \n\nThe call has
  gone out once more, and so now I'm presenting <em>my</em> advice.\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nVisit
  the IRC channel. (irc.freenode.net - #sfucsss) - it's populated\nmostly by ex-CSSS
  who are industry professionals, and we know\neverything about everything.\n</li>\n\n<li>\nIf
  a course says \"Lecturer: Staff\" or \"Lecturer: TBA\", avoid it like\nyou would
  avoid gonorrhea - unless you look forward to a whole\nsemester of a clueless grad
  student reading PowerPoint slides off of\nan overhead projector.\n</li>\n\n<li>\nIf
  a course says \"Lecturer: Bart\", \"Lecturer: Mori\", \"Lecturer:\nVaughan\", or
  \"Lecturer: Baker\", take it.  It doesn't even matter what\nthey're teaching. Just
  take the course. I guarantee that it will be\nexcellent.\n</li>\n\n<li>\nOccasionally
  crack open a textbook. Sometimes the concept that the\nlecturer has utterly failed
  to teach is in there, and explained in\ndetail.\n</li>\n\n<li>\nTake notes in lecture
  and do the assignments, and nine times out of\nten, your review-for-the-final will
  be a breeze. The tenth time out of\nten, it's because your professor dropped a big
  ol' bridge-o-crazy on\nthe class, and you'll still do okay thanks to the magic of
  curved\ngrading.\n</li>\n\n<li>\nAll-nighters are a recipe for bad code.\n</li>\n\n<li>\nA
  lot of people come out of university with nothing to show for it on\na resume except
  a hollow degree and a tiny amount of Java experience.\nThis is bad. Do Co-ops, Project
  Courses, and Hard Courses. Do as many\nas you can.  It'll halve the time you spend
  in Junior Programming\npositions when you graduate.\n</li>\n\n<li>\nTry your very
  best not to do a co-op as a QA tester.  The only\nexperience that'll give you is
  how to be a QA tester. It's an unending\nloop of mediocre jobs.\n</li>\n\n<li>\nBring
  a towel.\n</li>\n\n<li>\nContribute to open-source projects.\n</li>\n\n<li>\nHave
  fun.\n</li>\n\n<li>\nYou will never be surrounded by as many members of the opposite\n(/same)
  sex in your age, education, and interest group as you will\nover the next 4-8 years.
  \ As computing science students, this may\noccasionally mean that you need to branch
  out and try courses in\nCriminology, Journalism, or Biology.  Join clubs.  Meet
  people.  You\ncan hide in the protective shell of Computing Science culture for
  the\nentirety of your degree, and that's just sad.\n</li>\n\n<li>\nSome students
  just come up to the mountain for classes, then go down\nimmediately afterward.  Soak
  up some SFU culture. Hang out somewhere.\n</li>\n\n<li>\nThe student newspaper is
  terrible, until you consider that it's\nwritten and edited almost entirely by amateur
  volunteers.  They do an\nexcellent job with limited experience and resources.</li>\n\n</ul>"
