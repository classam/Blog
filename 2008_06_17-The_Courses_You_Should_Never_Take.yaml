  a variety of different outcomes.  \n\nSome courses- like <acronym title=\"CMPT 300\">Operating
  Systems I</acronym> or <acronym title=\"CMPT 225\">Data Structures</acronym> are
  meant to teach some definite, real-world skills.\n\nSome courses combine theory
  and skills- like <acronym title=\"CMPT 371\">Networking</acronym>- with a big chunk
  of graph theory- or <acronym title=\"CMPT 379\">Compilers</acronym>, which works
  through theories of grammars.\n\nSome courses are all theory- some all skills.  As
  a young, blockheaded guy, I tend to like the 'skills' stuff a lot more than the
  'theory' stuff, but I realize that they're both an important part of the education.\n\nA
  number of courses are simply meant to help develop peripheral-but-also important
  theories and skills.  As a Computing Science major, taking a course on English or
  History won't help you one whit on paper- but you develop important critical thinking
  and communication skills.  Just reading and regurgitating blocks of text on a regular
  basis will make you a better reader and writer.  Kristen, for example, has grown
  immensely on account of her Criminology degree. The degree's hours of research and
  reading and papers have honed her reading, comprehension, research, presentation,
  and writing skills to a fine point.  Those skills don't just translate to Criminology-
  they're important in every profession.   \n\nThere are, however, a few sinkholes
  in SFU's ample course-structure.  Courses which are noble-sounding on paper, but
  lose everything in translation.\n\nLet's take, for example, CMPT 275, \"Software
  Engineering\".  The course is a noble thought- how does one actually go about planning
  and producing a big software product?  \n\nThe course, however, loses everything
  in translation.  I'm not going to go too far into how- we've been talking about
  it for <a title=\"An old forum thread about how 275 is ass\" href=\"http://csss.cs.sfu.ca/forum/read.php?34,1312,2128#msg-2128\">ages</a>
  and <a title=\"Cory complaining about 275\" href=\"http://cultivatingboredom.com/two-out-of-three-aint-bad/\">ages</a>.\n\nI've
  also heard that under the more-competent eye of Toby Donaldson down in Surrey, the
  course is actually a lot better.  \n\nMaybe that's a bad example- the course was
  a good idea after all, they just needed someone competent to pull it off.\n\nOkay,
  let's try CMPT 212, \"Object Oriented Programming in C++\".  This course has long
  been one of SFU CS's legendary sinkholes- a random grad student is pulled out of
  a hat to throw malformed C++ and ancient GUI code at you until you cry like a little
  girl. \n\nNo, wait, Ted Kirkpatrick taught the course one semester and it was apparently
  quite well done. \n\nWhere am I going with this?  \n\nWell, as an SFU student, you
  are frequently called upon to choose between courses.  A lot of older students will
  say \"Avoid Course X\", or \"Avoid Course Y\"-  and here's what you should do:  Ask
  what professor they took the course with.  Now your job is to \"Avoid Professor
  X\" and \"Avoid Professor Y\"- and they might move from course to course, so you
  have to watch out for that.  A good professor can take almost any course and make
  it worthwhile.  A bad professor can take any course and make it punishing and pointless.
  \n\nAnd avoid grad students (or \"Sessionals\")- some of them are good, competent
  lecturers, but these specific grad students exist only as a theoretical mathematical
  construct.  The one <em>you</em> get will not speak English.\n\nAs a postscript,
  though, some courses are just plain stupid.  I'm lookin' at you, <a title=\"Cory
