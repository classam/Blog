  and cel-phone at home- not exactly a great start.  I went to sleep at a slightly
  more reasonable time, securing almost a full 8 hours of sleep, but that just seemed
  to make me more tired.  I've been exhausted all week.  I'd love to get more sleep
  tonight, but it's already almost 11:00 (the 8-hour mark) and if I want clean clothes
  to change into tomorrow, I'm going to have to baby this laundry load until at least
  11:15. \n\nGetting my schedule running properly is going to be tough.  9 hours at
  work (assuming a 1 hour lunch) + 3 hours of transit + 8 hours of sleep leaves only
  4 hours of leeway, which isn't a whole lot of time for things like .. well, food
  and such. \n\nSo, after getting a temp badge, I met my team for the first time.
  \ There's Joshua, who seems to have a great deal of knowledge on every conceivable
  topic, Graham, who seems like the ponytail-wearing grizzled old code hero (I'd say
  he's maybe in his early thirties, which is old by software dev. standards).  If
  you can imagine what Dan will be like in another 6 or 7 years, this is it. Then
  there's a third guy. His name slips my mind. It's a good name, though. \n\nFirst
  things first, I got the intro speech. \"So, you might be disappointed, but we don't
  actually work on games here. We do /*configuration management blah blah blah*/\"\n\nI
  had to at some point interject that I was not, in fact, disappointed by this- I
  chose the ORCA team specifically because I was interested in /*configuration management
  blah blah*/.  This seemed like a pleasant surprise for Joshua, who clearly had disappointed
  a couple of co-ops in his day.\n\nHe gave me a few resources to peruse over the
  course of the day, and I sunk in.  I had a bit of setting up to do- two monitors,
  but they were configured backwards, and the Start Menu wasn't where I wanted it
  to be.  I bookmarked some of my Firefox favourites and set up an odd program or
  two- then delved into documentation. \n\nThen came lunch.  There was a suitable
  amount of bitching about the old co-op.  It seems like once again, I'm replacing
  someone who wasn't very gung-ho about his job.  Just like at RIM. Apparently, some
  co-ops are so disappointed about being placed on a Tools team that they just fold
  up and stop caring entirely.  \n\nOn top of that, he didn't like seafood.\n\nThis
  is good for me, of course- as always, the low expectations set by the flaky last
  guy will change how the team thinks of me- and I'm a pretty chipper, gung-ho, get-things-done
  type of guy.\n\nHonestly, the game guys are probably debugging C++ code in almost-complete-games
  all summer, and that sounds to me like a very flavour-packed layer of hell anyways.
  I get excited about Perforce and Buildforge and that sort of thing.\n\nAfter lunch
  was a meeting. My manager was in-and-out, and she's off doing some presentations
  or something for a few weeks- I guess I'm directly reporting to Joshua for now.
  \ They did some questions around the table about what to call the team- the whole
  department is going with \"Works\" in the title- Artworks, Techworks, and we're...
  not sure, yet.  I suggested \"Skunkworks\" and one girl went \"Eeew\"- perhaps she
  didn't know the long and illustrious history behind<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_works\">
  the name</a>.\n\nI was introduced as \"The Co-Op\", which is my role.  I tried to
  play up as much as possible that I know how generally useless and temporary I am,
  with a smile.  \n\nLater, I drew Asok on my whiteboard, with a list of my various
  skills. (\"Portable!\")\n\nAt the end of the day, I had a list of some questions,
  got them answered, wrote them down, and took off (early) for Harbour Centre, where
  I'm taking CMPT 470 with Greg Baker. \n\nOh woe is me, there will be no sleep this
  semester. \n\nI didn't budget enough time to get there, I think, and arrived 15
  minutes late.  It wasn't too consequential, though- he was describing course preliminary
  stuff- where the marks are coming from, what the assignments are going to be, administrative
  mumbo jumbo\n\nThen, after that, he went into an intro to web development, which
  included a big chunk of information on the topic of Valid Markup- which, I have
  to say, I already know pretty well.  It was slow, and I spent most of the class
  sketching out ideas for the project that I'll be working on with Ryan and Sepand.
  \n\nI was actually quite impressed with Greg's lecture.  He didn't use <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=309\">Powerpoint</a>,
  he spoke clearly, confidently, and charismatically, and he used lots of examples.
  \ I've known him for a while and I've never actually heard him lecture- so.. huzzah.
  \n\nI'm just hoping there's something I can learn from the class- I've already worked
  as a web 'professional' (and I say that in big quotes because it was on intranet-only
  software) and while I certainly appreciate a class where I can just use existing
  expertise to whop together an A, learning a few things here and there can be nice
  too.  Given the solid coverage that he gave XHTML, though, I'm sure I'll pick up
  some best practices that I didn't know about before. \n\nAfter class, I took the
  Skytrain home with Sepand and Ryan to start discussing our project.  I immediately
  decided I'd nab 'team lead' because I have the most experience with websy stuff,
  and because I'm an egomaniac.  I asked if anybody had any ideas, and we all started
  tossing some things out.  I suggested we prepare one-page briefs for our ideas and
  toss them in a pot next week to sort and decide on one.\n\nAfter that, we started
  describing all of our various ideas- Sepand thought of a system for farmers to hook
  up their wares with local restaurants and stores.. which was a good idea, but I
  thought it might be tough to find test users.  Sepand also thought of a system for
  online code reviews, which poses an interesting challenge and could be a good project.\n\nI
  tossed out a few things- a better WebCT (and by better, I mean 'a whole lot less
  features, a whole lot more not sucking'), a system for managing and swapping online-game-account-credentials
  (like Wii Friend Codes, XBox Gamertags, Steam accounts, blah blah blah), and a tree-shaped
  Wiki for smaller, more focused/organized bits of documentation.\n\nSo far, I think
  the most popular idea's been the system for managing online game-account credentials.
  We might do away with the briefs entirely and just start brainstorming features
  for that.  The only problem we saw was that it wasn't complex enough to be interesting,
  but in the skytrain ride alone we thought of at least a couple of inherent problems
  that might require a little bit of noodle-scratchin' .  On top of that, we could
  put together a Facebook plugin for the whole tool.\n\nSounds neat. I seriously need
  to go finish that laundry and get to sleep, though. Night all!"
