content: ! "So, I tried <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinoa\">Quinoa</a>
  in Peru, and liked it.  \n\nOver here, though, it's marketed as a SUPER HEALTHY
  MCHEALTH FOOD.  I thought I'd try making some.\n\nChecking the wikipedia article,
  apparently it can be cooked in a rice-cooker, just like normal rice, using the same
  amount of water and the \"white rice\" setting. \n\nSo I tried that.  Then I loaded
  it up with diced sausage, fresh basil, and chili oil, with a pinch of salt and a
  little bit of seasoning salt. \n\nAnd it was good. "
