content: ! "Not that the most of you are overly concerned with my schedule, but next
  semester, I'm taking Artificial Intelligence, Operating Systems 2, and Animation
  from the Interactive Arts & Technology department. \n\nI also (as-of-yet) don't
  have a job lined up.\n\nThis is unprecedented for me- I've had a job every semester
  that I've been at SFU so far.  Retail, TAing, all sorts of things. Next semester,
  I have nothing lined up- I've purposefully lined up nothing whatsoever.  Maybe some
  contract work? I don't know.  I'm sure I'll figure something out. "
