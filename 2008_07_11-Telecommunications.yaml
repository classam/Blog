content: ! "It's become a widespread theme amongst my friends- we <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2008/07/08/text-messages.html?ref=rss\">hate
  telecom companies</a>.  We hate them *SO MUCH*.\n\nWonder why I don't use the browser
  on my phone, much? Well, it's a Motorola phone (silly me), so the browser is terrible,
  but even were I so inclined, Bell Mobility has decided that for me, network bandwidth
  should cost <strong>$51.28/MB</strong>.  It says there right on my bill.  Wouldn't
  it be neat if your cel-phone doubled as a modem? Well, not if a gigabyte of data
  ($52,510.72) cost more than a <a href=\"http://www.lexus.ca/lexus/experience/en/home/vehicles/BE96ST2008/veh_intro.jsp?model=BE96ST&year=2008\">2008
  Lexus GS 350</a> (starting at $51,000). \n\nImagine that, instead, you've got one
  of the slightly more reasonable <a href=\"http://www.rogers.com/web/Rogers.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=GCT&template=wireless-products&sub_template=iphone_voice_data_packages\">Rogers
  3G Phone Plans</a>- these things are built for data, yeah, baby. You're still paying
  about $100 for that gigabyte.  Oh, it's a far cry from $52,510.72, but $100 is no
  chump change. \n\nA lot of my friends bitch and moan about this- and rightfully
  so.  Our cel-phone companies are reaming us, and there's not a lot that we can do
  about it.  This is a market seriously in need of some friendly competition. "
