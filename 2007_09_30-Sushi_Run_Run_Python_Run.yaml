  Up, Little Sushi\" />\n\nI spent most of Saturday skimming through <a href=\"http://www.djangobook.com/\">The
  Django Book</a> and <a href=\"http://www.diveintopython.org/\">Dive Into Python</a>.
  \ The Django Book would be really a lot more helpful if someone went about.. you
  know.. finishing it?  It was supposed to be completed by 2007... so they only have
  3 more months!  Get to work, lazy Django writers! \n\nSo, me and my roommates (less
  Mike, who went home to Guelph for the weekend) finally went on the sushi run.  The
  wait was enormous and there was *no host* to take down names- just an endless line
  of waitresses who would come along, take a name (and a person) off of the list,
  take those persons to a table, and bustle off into the distance.\n\nWe eventually
  managed to sit down (at 8:15) and start ordering foods.  The whole menu was 'americanized'
  (Instead of 'nigiri', it was called 'sushi'. Instead of 'maki', it was 'roll sushi'.
  Instead of 'kappa', it was 'cucumber'. They gave us spoons with our Miso Soup. Madness!)\n\n
  Round 1, as we termed it, was enormous.  Salmon & scallop sashimi, salmon & eel
  nigiri,  miso soup, gyoza, chicken teriyaki, spider roll, california roll, dynamite
  roll, and \"gold dragon roll\". \n\nThe chicken teriyaki was terrible- it tasted
  like boiled chicken with teriyaki sauce poured on top.  The california rolls were
  pretty bad, too- it wasn't crabmeat minced with japanese mayo, it was just.. blocks
  of crabmeat. The spider-roll, instead of lookin' like a huge-ass creepy spider (but
  containing a soft-shelled alaskan crab) just looked like a roll.\n\nAll in all,
  however, all-you-can-eat sushi is good, regardless of the quality of some of the
  rolls.    We'll probably be going back in a few weeks, once I get the rice out of
  my sinuses. \n\nI couldn't participate in Round 2- There was no way I was going
  to get any more sushi down. My roomates, however, ordered a whole sheet of goodies.
  Chicken Karage, Miso Soup, Hot & Sweet Soup, deep-fried wings, udon noodles, the
  whole cooked works.  The thing is- none of it ever arrived.  We were waiting a good
  half-an-hour for any item on the list to arrive, and eventually we flagged down
  a waitress. She said to order again and that we should get our last order in before
  9:45, which was last-call.\n\nRound 3, we ordered most of those things again- except
  the udon (they're filling) and with ice cream to finish off the meal (by this time
  I was ready to eat again) - and this time they actually arrived- although the ice-cream
  arrived first. \n\nWe walked home, stopping at the Sobey's on the way.  I restocked
  my refridgerator a bit.\n\nToday? Well, I woke up at 12:30 (aww-yeah), I'll be making
  myself some breakfast.. something big and greasy, with eggs and hashbrowns and bacon
  and what-have-you. Then I'm off to the gym to work off the eggs and hashbrowns and
  bacon and what-have-you.  I might stop by the Kinkos to turn <a href=\"http://www.diveintopython.org/\">Dive
  Into Python</a> into a printed-and-bound book that I can keep with me at all times.
  (It's a good book!) Which would give me something else to read on the cycles."
