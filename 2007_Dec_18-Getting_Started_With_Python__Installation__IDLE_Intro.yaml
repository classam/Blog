content: ! "Okay, I'm getting started on a new project, here- in between my witty
  (incoherent) ramblings, I'm going to try to toss in the occasional useful tutorial
  on a variety of topics that have already been covered over and over again on the
  internet.\n\nToday?  Getting started with Python.  As a quick intro to what the
  hell I'm talking about, Python is a very popular and powerful scripting language.
  \ Thanks to the fact that Python is a slim, concise language, with a huge community
  supporting it and a lot of libraries, it's a great choice for a first programming
  language.\n\nSo, at the beginning of a CS degree, you're going to get bombarded
  with a bunch of boring hocus-pocus about algorithms and pseudocode.  Now, of course,
  this is all important stuff... but it's all boring, so let's get right into the
  meat and bones of programming. \n\nWhich, of course, requires that you have Python
  installed on your computer. Let's get you started.  First of all, let's determine
  what operating system you're running.  Look at your screen- is it bright blue, with
  various error messages? You're using <strong>Windows</strong>.  Look again- Do you
  suddenly feel like you're not nearly trendy enough, and that you should probably
  buy a scarf and beret? You're using a <strong>Mac</strong>.  Finally, if you're
  looking at your screen and you are filled with waves of disdain for the entire human
  race, you're probably using some flavor of <strong>Linux</strong>.\n\nFor <strong>Mac</strong>
  users, well, I can't help you.  I don't have a Mac.  Should you require a more comprehensive
  tutorial, please pony up the $1200 required for me to get my grubby hands on a MacBook.
  <strong> Edit: </strong> Okay, I bought myself a MacBook.  Good news, everyone-
  Python comes pre-installed on your Mac.  To get started, open a Terminal (you'll
  find it in /Applications/Utilities) and type in the word \"python\".\n\nFor <strong>Ubuntu
  Linux</strong> users (i.e., <strong>Ubuntu</strong> users), you're.. well, you're
  all set.  Python is automatically part of every Ubuntu installation. Good on you!
  To get started, open a Terminal and type in the word \"python\". \n\nFor <strong>
  Other Linux Users </strong>.. well, you're running Linux on your own. I'm going
  to assume that you've got your shit together. \n\nFor <strong>Windows</strong> users,
  the process is quite simple- go to <a title=\"Python\" href=\"http://www.python.org/download/\">python.org</a>
  and grab the Python 2.5.1 Windows Installer. Don't go to python.net, that's not
  what you're looking for.  Especially don't go to python.com- that's just porn, the
  chewy caramel core of the internet. If the Windows Installer has a higher number
  than 2.5.1 (For example: \"2.5.2\"), raise your arms in the air and cheer thusly:
  \"Woo\". \n\nHaving installed Python, you now have a \"Python\" group in your Start
  Menu, with a variety of links- IDLE (Python GUI), Module Docs, Python (Command Line),
  Python Manuals, and Uninstall Python.  The next step is to uninstall Python. (No,
  it's not, I'm full of lies.)\n\nWhat you're going to be using is IDLE- a lightwieght
  <strong>I</strong>ntegrated <strong>D</strong>evelopment <strong>E</strong>nvironment.
  \ An IDE is a tool to make programming a little easier.. and Python was inspired
  by Monty Python.. one of whom is Eric Idle.. so.. yeah. There you go.  I have yet
  to see anything in the Python world named after John Cleese, but only time will
  tell. \n\nSo, you've started IDLE and you're faced with some version information,
  some unwanted license information, and a warning about personal firewall software,
  followed by some more version information and finally the handy command prompt.
  \">>>\", it goes. \">>>\". Just.. taunting you.  Quickly, man, you need to show
  it who's boss! Tell it who's boss!\n\n<strong>Now you're at a Python command line.</strong>\n\n<div
  style=\"background-color:black; color:lime; font-family:monospace; padding: 10px
  10px 10px 10px;\"> \n>>> Up yours, Python! <br/>\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n</div>\n\nHm..
  that didn't work. It threw a Syntax Error.. and what is a Syntax Error, anyways?
  Well, it means that you did something that Python didn't understand. So, uh, stop
  it, or Python will be very very angry with you.  Let's tell it to print a seven.\n\n<div
  style=\"background-color:black; color:lime; font-family:monospace; padding: 10px
  10px 10px 10px;\"> \n>>> print 7<br/>\n7\n</div>\n\nSee, that's some quality output.
  A seven! Think of all the things that you can do with that! You could .. um.. okay,
  it's useless. How about we do some math. \n\n<div style=\"background-color:black;
  color:lime; font-family:monospace; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;\"> \n>>> print
  7<br/>\n7<br/>\n>>> print 7+7<br/>\n14<br/>\n>>> print 7*7<br/>\n49<br/>\n>>> print
  7/7<br/>\n1\n</div>\n\nOkay, so now your $2000 computer is roughly as useful as
  a $1 calculator. Clearly, we're getting places, here.  Now, traditionally the first
  thing anybody learns to do in any programming language is print the words  \"Hello
  World\", so let's take a go at that.\n\n<div style=\"background-color:black; color:lime;
  font-family:monospace; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;\"> \n>>> print Hello, World<br/>\nSyntaxError:
  invalid syntax\n</div>\n\nOh no! We've failed again!  \n\n<div style=\"background-color:black;
  color:lime; font-family:monospace; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;\"> \n>>> print
  \"Hello, World\"<br/>\nHello, World\n</div>\n\nThere we go. You need to add quotes
  around the words that you want to print. Good stuff, good stuff. On top of that,
  you can do math with the words, too. \n\n<div style=\"background-color:black; color:lime;
  font-family:monospace; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;\"> \n>>> print \"LO\" * 10
  + \"L\", \"OMGWTF\" <br/>\nLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL OMGWTF\n</div>\n\nOf course, you
  can't subtract or divide letters, because Python doesn't want to go to all of the
  trouble of displaying half of an \"L\". That would be a pain in the ass!\n\n<div
  style=\"background-color:black; color:lime; font-family:monospace; padding: 10px
  10px 10px 10px;\"> \n>>> print \"LLLL\" - \"L\" <br/>\n<br/>\nTraceback (most recent
  call last):<br/>\n  File \"pyshell#20\", line 1, in module<br/>\n    print \"LLLL\"
  - \"L\"<br/>\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'<br/>\n</div>\n\nWow,
  that's a painful error message. It's a long and roundabout way of saying that you
  can't '-' a 'str' and a 'str'. - Translated into English, you can't subtract a word
  from a word- at least not that way.\n\nIf you're using IDLE in windows, you get
  something that the Ubuntu users don't- you get colours. Colours are good, they make
  code easier to read.  If the Ubuntu users in the crowd are jealous of the colourful
  world of IDLE, you can always pick it up in Ubuntu's \"Add/Remove Programs\" area,
  easy as pie.\n\n<strong>Okay, now let's write a program. </strong>\nOkay, quick,
  let's write a python program and run it, in python.  The process for doing this
  is different for Mac/Ubuntu and Windows users. \n\n<strong> Mac/Ubuntu </strong>\n<ol>\n<li>
  Create a text file. 'awesome.py'</li>\n<li> In the text file, write <code>&nbsp;print
  \"Hello World\"&nbsp;</code> </li>\n<li> Open the Terminal.  </li>\n<li> Navigate
  to the text file. (The <code>man</code>, <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code> commands
  are your friends. ) </li>\n<li> Enter 'python awesome.py' </li>\n<li> Done! </li>\n</ol>\n\n<strong>
  Windows </strong>\nI'm .. er.. not at my Windows computer right now, and I can't
  remember how this goes. Ner... I'll get back to this a bit later. \n\n\nGood luck
  for now and I'll see you again next time for more explanatory goodness! "
