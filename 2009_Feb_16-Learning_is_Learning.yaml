content: ! "Here's what I've found so far: \n\nSqueak eToys:  So far, in Vista, it
  refuses to save- which is like the third thing I tried to do.  I had to go through
  months of backlogged developer discussion to figure out how to save something.  So
  I'm giving it a \"User Friendliness\" rating of immediate NO. \n\nAlice:  Alice
  2.0 has a great tutorial that pulls you through the basics. It's also as ugly as
  sin- and UI is a bit complicated, still.  I hope Alice 3.0 comes out soon.  \n\nLOGO:
  I can't even get Kristen to look at LOGO.  It's 'programming', not a game. Sure,
  it's an easy programming language, but... no.  \n\nSo, having exhausted the suggestions,
  I found \"Scratch\" mentioned in a blog post about Squeak eToys - And I downloaded
  it.\n\nHuzzah! Scratch isn't very advanced- not at all- but it's the most user-friendly
  introduction to programming I've ever seen. \n\nIt's not the most powerful programming
  system ever- in fact, it lacks even the most basic of functionality in most places-
  but it's slick."
