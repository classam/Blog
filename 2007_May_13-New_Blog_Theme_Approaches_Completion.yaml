  />\n\nYou might have been wondering- why, oh why, has Curtis left his blog in \"Ye
  Ugly\" mode for so long?\n\nIt's because I was working on a brand spankin' new blog
  theme. \n\nOne more attractive! One more reliable! One that doesn't break in Internet
  Explorer 7! (Try it!)\n\nIt's not quite complete, yet- there are still a few steps
  that need to be undertaken to really consider it 'finished'. But it's getting closer-
  and it's close enough to launch and start testing. \n\nWoo!"
