  It''s that time again! When family members and friends start bothering me to put
  together a list of things that I want to own.


  Apparently, the list is fun to read (?) although I''ve found that after reading
  what''s on the list, my assorted family members go off and buy me whatever they
  were planning on buying me anyways - most of the list items requiring either an
  extended amount of time hunting through bookstores, or an online purchase, to actually
  procure.


  After Christmas, I usually ending up buying myself a thing or two from the list,
  so it all works out for the best.


  If you''re curious about those goods I consider "Want To Have", or merely want to
  get started on your own *very nerdy* wish list, check it out.
