content: ! 'Well, I''ve never found<a href="http://www.pvponline.com"> PVP</a> very
  funny (I read it anyways..)


  But the last couple of guest comics have been hilarious.

  The strip by Danielle Corsetto from <a href="http://www.daniellecorsetto.com/gws.html">Girls
  With Slingshots</a> was hilarious enough so that now I have to evaluate Girls With
  Slingshots.. possibly from the beginning.

  The strip by Lar Desouza &amp; Ryan Sohmer from <a href="http://www.leastIcouldDo.com">Least
  I Could Do</a> was pretty good- Least I Could Do has been on my sidebar (---&gt;)
  for a month or so- A new addition, but possibly the funniest thing on there.

  Chris Giarusso finally made the "Mothafuckin'' Snakes on a Mothafuckin'' Plane"
  joke funny. Good for him!'
