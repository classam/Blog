content: ! "In recent news, recently, Paul Graham wrote a <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html\">self-serving
  blog post</a> about how everybody should be starting their own company.  Jeff Atwood
  called him <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001080.html\">a narcissist</a>.
  Everybody else on the internet made the simple-but-apt connection that Paul Graham-
  who *has a <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/\">company that makes money from startup
  founders</a>*, might have a vested interest in- I don't know- convincing people
  to start companies. \n\nI, for one, have heard enough about this, and therefore
  turn my interest back to <a href=\"http://icanhascheezburger.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/funny-pictures-happy-chair-enjoying-life.jpg\">internet
  memes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.antipode.ca/2008/your-browsers-command-line/\">Allen
  Pike rambling about web browsers</a>."
