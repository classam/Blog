content: ! "We've all had to deal with computer security at one time or another- somebody
  in the family has a nasty virus or some malware on their computer, and they want
  you to get rid of it. \n\nI used to do this-  now, I don't. \n\nOnce you get something
  nasty on your computer- it's game over, man, game over.  Malware nowadays gets itself
  so wedged in to your operating system that it takes hours, specialized tools, and
  arcane knowledge to exorcise it.  \n\nThe recipes on the internet for removing Antivirus
  2009 involve changing Malwarebytes around so that the malware can't stop it from
  running, going into safe mode, scrubbing the hard drive three or four times across
  three or four reboots, using a few other anti-malware products, scrubbing your USB
  drives, ritually murdering five orphans in a grand midnight ceremony and sprinkling
  their blood across the computer's hard drive, and then manually changing registry
  values.  Even then, there's still the chance that the malware is still on your computer,
  sending out spam, reading your mail, and generally cocking things up. \n\nThere's
  an easy way to clear all of the malware off of your computer- easy as pie.  Format
  the hard drive.  Ta daaaaa!  No more malware.  \n\nOf course, you now have to reinstall
  your operating system and all of your favourite software- as well as any media that
  you had sitting on your primary hard drive. \n\nYou've also lost all of your pictures,
  all of your documents, all of everything.  This is why we make backups of important
  things.\n"
