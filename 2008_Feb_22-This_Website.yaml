  \ But many of you might not know that this is maybe the third iteration of the site.
  \ \n\ncurtis.lassam.net is powered by Wordpress.  \n\nThe first website theme was
  one of the first Wordpress themes I had ever put together.  If I'm lucky, we shall
  never speak of it again.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/projects/travelous-small.png\"
  alt=\"The Second Theme\" /> \n\nThe second website theme, named \"Travelous\",  had
  served me in good stead for over a year.  It was simple, it had lots of curved lines,
  and worked with my innate love of themes that combine a single colour with white
  and black. (You'll notice that same thing about the current theme.) While it was,
  at least in my opinion, attractive, it lacked a few features that were really important
  to me.  It wouldn't validate as XHTML, it wasn't very standards-compliant, it didn't
  display well on mobile phones, and the layout wasn't very flexible. It didn't display
  as well in Safari or Internet Explorer 7.  The CSS was poorly organized and difficult
  to read. There were lots of problems with it that needed retooling. Thus, the third
  theme.\n\nThis new website theme, \"Georgia Caboose\", is the one you're looking
  at right now.  It's actually less visually compelling than the last one- but it
  has that element about blogs that I love so much, simplicity.  It's designed to
  use only one font, \"Georgia\", and comes with my caboose logo plastered all over
  the place.  \n\n<ul> \n <li>Even</li>\n <li>in </li>\n <li>the </li>\n <li>lists.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThanks
  to the fact that the site is written using only 100% <acronym title=\"Except for
  those damned YouTube bits.\">XHTML compliant</acronym> code, the CSS file is small
  and easy to work with.  I've improved the site's flexibility and accessibility,
  and I'm happy about that.\n\n<blockquote> I think that the blockquotes are quite
  distinctive, too. </blockquote>\n\nThe site's also pretty flexible in it's layout.
  \ Try it- resize the page a bit.  It grows. It shrinks.  If you go below a certain
  threshold and leave it there, it'll do away with the sidebar entirely- this with
  my first-ever foray into JavaScript.  \n\nSo, where do I go from here?  Well, the
  site still needs a mobile and a print stylesheet.  Being as I've been learning more
  and more JavaScript over time, the site-resizing algorithm could be improved. "
