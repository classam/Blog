content: ! "<em>Edit:</em>I started with 17 links, but I pruned them down to 10 to
  keep the format consistent. Goodbye, <a href=\"http://io9.com/5452388/after-peak-oil-well-have-to-rely-on-pure-sex-energy-%5Bnsfw%5D\">sex-powered
  Italy</a>.\n\nIf you're wondering, I do sort these by subjective awesomeness , so
  the \"Number 1\" is \"Pretty definitely awesome\" and the \"Number 17\" is \"Not
  interesting enough to include, but my soul aches just a little when I get rid of
  it.\"  \n\nAlso, I'm subscribed to 40-odd developmenty codey blogs, but very few
  of them make it to the Top 10.  Where are all the interesting articles you guys?
  \n\n<h3> Number 10: I Love Typography </h3>\nILT's released a list of their favourite
  fonts of 2009, and they are <a href=\"http://ilovetypography.com/2010/01/21/my-favourite-fonts-of-2009/\">just
  gorgeous</a>.\n\n<h3> Number 9: Left-Handed Toons </h3>\nSome people just need to
  <a href=\"http://www.lefthandedtoons.com/664/\">climb collisions</a>.\n\n<h3> Number
  8: Coco Vs. Leno, In Chinese </h3>\nHonestly, I didn't care about the whole Conan
  O'Brien/Jay Leno thing. Seriously, I don't even watch TV, and I really wasn't sure
  what exactly was going on.  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ9m1an-pQ8\">This
  Chinese animation </a>explains the whole thing and manages to be funny, to-boot.
  \n\n<h3> Number 7: Picture Of The Future </h3>\nI don't care if I don't think they're
  accurate, people who draw <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/fMAts.jpg\"> detailed images
  of the imaginary future</a> are always all-right by me.  I could look at this sort
  of thing all day.\n\n<h3> Number 6: Carry On Bags Now Allowed in U.S. </h3>\nOkay,
  so the recent \"you're not allowed to carry anything on to a plane if you're going
  to the states\" thing, which everybody thought was ridiculous (except for the people
  forced to wait as you try to cram an entire grand piano into the overhead storage
  compartment) - <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/01/20/flight-rules.html?ref=rss#socialcomments\">has
  ended</a>.  Now, I'm planning on making a trip to Far-Off Lands with a stop-over
  in the States, in the near future, and so this news item fills me with OVERFLOWING
  JOY, even though I still am not excited about having to go through the American
  airport system.\n\n<h3> Number 5: Dinosaur Comics Builds Equity </h3>\nTyrannosaurus
  is uncomfortable <a href=\"http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1636\">with the
  thought of such a large purchase</a>. Perhaps this is because Ryan North lives in
  Toronto, which is almost as expensive to live in as Surrey.\n\n<h3> Number 4: Ok
  Go </h3>\nOk Go's new music video can't be embedded, or even viewed in some countries.
  \ They're famous because of a  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv5zWaTEVkI\">viral
  video from 2006</a>, so they're pretty unhappy about this. They address the topic
  in a <a href=\"http://okgo.forumsunlimited.com/index.php?showtopic=4169\">Open Letter
  To Everybody</a>, about the horrors of music labels and what-have-you. \n\n<h3>
  Number 3: The Perfect Cup Of Espresso </h3>\nI'm not even that interested in how
  to make a perfect cup of espresso- it seems to require hideously expensive machinery
  and precision and time... but this <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2010/01/19/search-for-the-ultim.html\">video
  talking about the perfect cup</a> is just <em>lush</em>.  The sharp focus and careful
  use of color are things you don't usually see in web video.  Also, if your workspace
  has an espresso machine and you didn't know how to use it before, you can watch
  something similar happen here. So that's nice. \n\n<h3>  Number 2: Ok Go Cupid </h3>\nThe
  devs behind OkCupid.com's dating services occasionally produce some surprising metrics.
  In this case, they take a look at pictures and associated 'success rates', trying
  to determine <a href=\"http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/2010/01/20/the-4-big-myths-of-profile-pictures/\">features
  of a good dating profile pic</a>. \n\n<h3> Number 1: GREAT SCOTT! </h3>\nA band
  called \"The Heavy\" performed on David Letterman, and they were so solid that Letterman
  asked for an encore - they just <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jirhtas7imE\">kept
  playing through the commercial break</a>. I've never seen that before. \n\n<em>
  Edit: YouTube's new policy of deleting anything that gets popular is making me an
  angry dude.  I should locally cache anything that I top-ten, dammit. Here's another
  shot at that <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/late_night/late_show/video/?pid=PMZn0ZshOfdkqPhyLc_5uASnrFZKAgkd&play=true&vs=Default\">The
  Heavy</a> clip.</em>"
