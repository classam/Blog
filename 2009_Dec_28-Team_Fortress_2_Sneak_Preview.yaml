content: ! "So, I have a new bookshelf. (Boring, I know.) So, now, I'm converting
  my HUGE UNGAINLY PILE OF OLD BOOKS AND MAGAZINES into a HUGE UNGAINLY BOOKSHELF.
  Big improvement! Soon I will have books for trade, donation, or throwin' out. \n\nWell,
  that all leads into the big pile of old gaming magazines I have, which I flip through
  every time I do this.  There's something different and interesting each time! \n\nThis
  time? A Team Fortress 2 Sneak Preview, from the YEAR 2000! Back when the game had
  4 teams and 12 classes! Back when it was supposed to be a cinematic World War 2
  clone! With screenshots! See it <a href=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/images/old_magazines/tf2_preview.jpg\">here</a>!
  \n\nBut that's not all. The same magazine had an awesome (albeit short) <a href=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/images/old_magazines/tim_schafer.jpg\">interview
  with Tim Schafer</a>! \n\nBut that's not all! I also found, in a different, much
  older magazine, a <a href=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/images/old_magazines/dune_2_sneak_preview.jpg\">Sneak
  Preview of Dune 2</a>. Yeah. Ooold magazine. \n\nBut that's not all!\n\n... Oh.
  Okay, that's all. You may go about your business. "
