content: ! "The weekend is over, I take to my task anew.  I'm having fun pretending
  to be a content aggregator. I've signed up to every RSS feed I can get my grubby
  hands on, but even then I have trouble finding 10 things that I consider notable.
  \ Today was mostly noise and very little signal.\n\n<h3>Number 10 - Sinfest Turns
  10</h3>\nI don't understand how Tatsuya Ishida produces a lush, beautiful comic
  strip every single day, almost without fail.  So now, 10 full years from his first
  strip and we're at <a href=\"http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=3422\">comic
  3422</a>. For people who haven't read the entire archives, it's very similar to
  his first-ever post, 10 years ago. \n\n<h3>Number 9 - Write An O(n^n) Algorithm
  </h3>\nProggit intentionally writes algorithms <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ar5uc/write_an_onn_algorithm/\">that
  are very, very slow</a>. Fun times? Maybe.\n\n<h3> Number 8 - A Cat With A Bowtie
  </h3>\nThis one is <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Q1ifC.jpg\">exactly what it says
  on the tin</a>.\n\n<h3> Number 7 - Two Countries Pooh-Pooh IE </h3>\nIE has a big
  ol' security hole, and they don't plan to patch it until February 9.  Two countries,
  France and Germany, are now issuing government-wide recommendations <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8465038.stm\">against
  using the browser</a>.  And any time a whole country takes a potshot at a browser
  that you don't like, it's time for some celebrations.\n\n<h3> Number 6 - Ow. </h3>\nThe
  <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2010/01/18/science-tattoo-emporium-how-to-get-in/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+DiscoverMag+%28Discover+Magazine%29&utm_content=Google+Reader\">periodic
  table of ARM</a>, just one in a series of Science Tattoos that Discover Magazine
  has been collecting pictures of. \n\n<h3> Number 5 - Pigz </h3>\nMark Adler, writer
  of zlib, is now working on a parallel compression utility called '<a href=\"http://dobbscodetalk.com/index.php?option=com_myblog&show=Pigz-on-the-Wing.html&Itemid=29\">pigz</a>'.\n\n<h3>
  Number 4 - Hammock </h3>\nNedroid provides a <a href=\"http://nedroid.com/comic/comics-rss/2010-01-18-beartato-hammock.gif\">whole
  new world of comfort. </a> Unfurl!\n\n<h3> Number 3 - The Unbroken Thread </h3>\n<a
  href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOLAGYmUQV0\">The Symphony Of Science is back
  to autotuning Carl Sagan</a>, this time with some David Attenborough and Jane Goodall
  mixed in.  It's catchy and inspiring, although that doesn't mean it's going to be
  part of my regular library of tunes. \n\n<h3> Number 2 - 25 High Quality Free Fonts
  </h3>\nI collect fonts. Do you collect fonts? Smashing Magazine went and found<a
  href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/18/25-new-high-quality-free-fonts/\">
  some free ones</a>. Hooray!\n\n<h3> Number 1 - Tor Science Fiction Reading Protocols
  </h3>\nAn article about <a href=\"http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=58637\">how
  we read science fiction</a>. Okay, maybe it's a bit self-congratulatory, but who
  doesn't like a bit of that in their day-to-day life?\n\n"
