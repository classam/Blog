  set the dial to &quot;Over 40/Male&quot;, and drew some of the most entertaining
  people to come up.&nbsp;

  This one was fun. Old guys with hats are probably the most entertaining thing to
  draw.

  One fellow didn&#39;t have the gumption to actually show his face.&nbsp; Everybody
  loves a miscellaneous baseball player!

  When I saw this guy, I actually, physically, laughed. I think, if I ever have a
  company in need of a logo, this is what I&#39;m using (I have a cleaned up and inked
  version of this adorning the back of my laptop)


  So, then, later, I just started doodling random things.

  I was doodling chefs, and all of a sudden, I though of my Uncle Antonio, and I wondered
  if I could adequately caricature him from memory..

  .. So, after my &#39;generic chef&#39; drawing, I started doodling my uncle, and
  I think it turned out pretty well.


  Finally, to round this all out, a healthy dose of nerd!
