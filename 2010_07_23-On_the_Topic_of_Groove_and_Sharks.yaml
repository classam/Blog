  afternoon, the internet. I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of not working especially
  hard, and tunes, have just discovered a new internet service.\n\nA few years ago,
  I fell in love with Pandora, an online radio service.  I give it a song, it recommends
  songs that are like the song that I gave it.\n\n<strong>Because you liked</strong>:
  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Guqhnz4N38\">Aqua - Roses are Red</a>\n\n<strong>We
  recommend</strong>: A sharp blow to the head. What the hell, dude. \n\nI'm pretty
  sure that I found <a title=\"Ladytron - Ghosts\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yaEwcmrR4Q&feature=avmsc2\">Ladytron</a>
  as a direct result of Pandora recommendations, so, awesome.  But then, <em>gasp</em>,
  they stopped offering Pandora in Canada.  They say that it is due to 'licensing
  restrictions', but in Canada, we know that's a bunch of crap. It's actually because
  they hate Canadians, on account of our universal body hair and constant moustache
  parties.\n\nSo I gave up on internet radio.  Pandora won my heart, and then broke
  it, and then threw it at the wall, then put it in a blender, then ate it, then regurgitated
  it, then reconstituted it, then put it in a box, then sent it to France.\n\nIt wasn't
  until just today that I discovered <a href=\"http://www.grooveshark.com\">Grooveshark</a>,
  a service superior to Pandora in just about every way.  The song selection is as
  massive and unrestricted as my passion for steamed hot-dogs.  I pick songs that
  I like, drop them into a playlist, and then can listen to them.  It's like having
  iTunes, but connected to everybody's library.  \n\nIt has a built-in recommendation
  engine, so I can once-again be aurally punished for listening to <a title=\"Ace
  of Base - Unspeakable\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nxjxSONCA8\">absolutely
  terrible bands</a>. I can also save playlists that I like and <del>use them to punish</del>
  <em>share them with</em> my friends. \n\nThe only catch is that they occasionally
  play an advertisement.  The advertisements are, at least in my imagination, context
  sensitive - so, if I listen to a lot of Cake music, they will try to sell me <a
  href=\"http://www.threadless.com/product/2377/I_Was_Here\">ironic T-shirts</a> and
  <a href=\"http://www.shopping.com/-wigs+moustaches+beards+for+sale\">beards</a>
  and <a href=\"http://www.bustedtees.com/beards\">ironic T-shirts with beards on
  them</a>.  If I listen to a lot of death metal, they will try to sell me the beating
  heart of a llama. If I listen to a lot of Aqua, they will try to sell me Disney
  products and euthanasia. \n\nSo, long-and-needlessly-meandering-post aside, if you
  are a desk-bound workdrone in need of more adequate tunescaping, I recommend poking
  around Grooveshark."
