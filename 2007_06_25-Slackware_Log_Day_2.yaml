  title=\"Slackware Log, Day 1\" href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=215\">Day
  One</a>, it's time for Day 2!\n\n22. Energetic, prepared to fight! Computer no match
  for clever individual such as myself.\n\n23. Fiddled with 'make menuconfig' a bit
  more. All of the framebuffer options seem to be set: Compiling causes the same problem
  as before, entirely blank screen.\n\n24. Internet searching for assorted vectors
  of '2.6', 'kernel' 'blank screen' 'linux' and 'slackware' end up leading me to a
  2.6 kernel compilation guide. Somebody makes a comment about how a blank screen
  means the framebuffer is screwed up (So I figured).  The suggestion is booting with
  the option 'vga=normal'.\n\n25.  Boot with option 'vga=normal'. The solution disables
  the framebuffer entirely, showing me that ugly default linux text background that
  I'm so accustomed to. Regardless, this is a big improvement on the empty screen
  I was dealing with before- I edit lilo.conf to reflect that 2.6 will always be running
  with vga=normal.\n\n26.  During boot, notice a bunch of internet configuration stuff
  rolling past.  Hey, it looks like my network card is up and running! Hooray! \n\n27.
  \ Invoke startx. KDE is even uglier than Gnome, but I don't like either. The resolution
  is 1024x768, which, on a monitor designed to support 1280x800 (widescreen) is probably
  the ugliest thing ever.  I remember (Thank to the 'log-book' that I kept for Ubuntu)
  the process for fixing this in Ubuntu was to switch from default VESA to i810 in
  xorg.conf, then install the 915resolution package from the repository. I also remember
  that discovering this obscure little gem of a package took about 6 hours of frustrated
  stabbing.\n\n28.  1024x768 hurts my eyes like nobody's business. \n\n29. In xorg.conf,
  change 'VESA' to 'i810'. Run startx. Everything works fine, but it's all still 1024x768.
  Looking at it causes eyes to panic and start jackhammering front of brain with tiny
  cudgels. \n\n30. Downloaded <a title=\"915resolution\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/stomljen/\">915resolution</a>
  package. Yay internet connection. I'd have worked on screen resolution before even
  DHCP if it weren't for the fact that I needed to download this package. 1280x800
  is important to me, dammit.\n\n31. Read instructions. Apparently, 915resolution
  needs to be run before xserver, every time. Look up where to put this so that I
  don't have to run it every time (/etc/rc.c/rc.local, apparently) \n\n32. Install
  915resolution.\n\n33. Before putting 915resolution in rc.local, decide to try a
  test run.  Run '915resolution 38 1280 800 24' to set 1280x800 resolution at 24bits/pixel.\n\n34.
  startx. The display is still 1024x768, but for some curious reason, the display
  is now larger than the monitor. By moving my mouse to the top of the screen, I can
  move around the display but I can't see it all at the same time.  This is just..
  baffling. Why the hell would this behavior be supported by KDE? \n Searching for
  help and reading docs in a stretched out and blurry 1024x768 has now piled on all
  the discomfort it can on my poor abused eyes, and I give up for the day to read
  some more Cryptonomicon and/or do some homework.\n"
