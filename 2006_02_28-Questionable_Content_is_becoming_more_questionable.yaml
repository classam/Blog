  Content</a>, you''d know that things are getting "Shit-hot" right now.  Perhaps
  poor Marten will get laid before I do, again - but the guy has been wussing out
  and putting up with coffee-shop girls for 3 years, and he has to deal with all of

  and <a href="http://www.cakemusic.com/">Cake</a> albums.'
