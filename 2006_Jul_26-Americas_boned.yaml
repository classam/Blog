content: ! 'So, I was google searching for the wait() system call, and I found a site
  called "It''s Great to Wait!" about abstinence. I thought to myself, "Oh, this seems
  hilarious!", so I thought I''d peruse the site. What I found was actually quite
  shocking and disturbing.  It turns out that abstinence is Florida''s *only* sex-ed
  policy.  Florida teens, instead of getting a balanced sexual education, just get
  lectures on chastity.  No safe-sex, no ''it''s okay to masturbate'', no ''this is
  how you get AIDS'', just ''no sex for you''.

  But it''s not just Florida.. it''s <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/pp2/portal/medicalinfo/teensexualhealth/fact-abstinence-education.xml">all
  the other states</a>, too!

  Except California, which coincidentally has the lowest teen-pregnancy and STI rates
  in the U.S...

  Here, take a look at two sites..


  This site is promoted to Florida youth.. <a href="http://www.greattowait.com/">It''s
  Great To Wait!</a>

  This site is promoted to (many) B.C. youth.. <a href="http://www.sexualityandu.ca/home_e.aspx">sexualityandu.ca

  </a>

  Now, if you had kids, which one would you be more comfortable with them visiting?'
