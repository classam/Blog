content: ! "I was having a chat with Angelina yesterday, and she's got a new project
  in the works- she calls it \"Bacon Breath\", and it is a fantastic thing that makes
  me happy.\n\nFor Christmas, Angelina was signed up by her fianc√© for the \"<a title=\"I
  Think This Is The Right Bacon-Of-The-Month Club\" href=\"http://www.gratefulpalate.com/?p=Category_11\">Bacon
  Of The Month</a>\" club. She also got robot-parts, which makes that the most kick-ass
  Christmas gift anybody has ever given or received, bar <acronym title=\"Gold, frankincense
  and myrrh? BACON AND ROBOT PARTS.\">none</acronym>.\n\nNow she resolves to fry and
  eat her monthly bacon, then describe it to us in glittering prose. On top of that,
  she promises that she will hunt down and consume other baconly treats for our amusement.
  \ She's on the lookout for talented bacon correspondents, too, so if you're in the
  mood for getting your bacon on and writing about it, she'd be glad to edit and aggregate
  it on <a title=\"Bacon Breath\" href=\"http://baconbreath.com/\">her site</a>. \n\nIt's
  a bacon bacon revolution! Catch bacon fever! You'll pay for the whole seat but you'll
  only need <b>the edge</b>!\n\nI wish Angelina the best of luck in her endeavor.
  Godspeed, Angelina, godspeed."
