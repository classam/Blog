content: ! "I was out drinking with my friend Allen a few nights ago. He was asking
  people at the table to talk about technologies that they used every day that were
  perhaps less fulfilling then they could be. \n\nI hemmed and hawed.  I've put so
  much time into my day-to-day technology that every step of the day is smooth and
  slick, aided by solid technology along the way.  \n\nThere are a few arenas where
  the technology just doesn't stack up - the Digital ACM Library is some sort of Coldfusion
  monstrosity, held together by hope and duct-tape and dreams.  Whenever I try to
  find good teaching materials, I'm consistently stumped by a half-assed collection
  of blogs, teacher forums, and what-have-you.  And when it comes to webcomic output,
  none of the self-publishing solutions are any good at all.\n\nBut most of these
  markets are aggressively niche.  I'm not a teacher, I'm not allowed to disseminate
  ACM materials (dammit), and while I aspire to be a webcomic author some-day, I just
  don't have the attention span required to write something hilarious every day -
  like, say, Zach Wiener.  Okay, I still might end up building a better comic publishing
  engine. It's totally on my list. \n\nBut then I thought of the biggest fish in the
  pond of websites falling out of my radar.\n\nReddit. \n\nOh, yeah, it was good.
  \ It was really good, in it's heydey, when it first started up, it's community was
  small and technical and smart and funny, and all of the submissions were small and
  technical and smart and funny, but it's become bloated with old articles and karma
  whores and pictures upon pictures of<a href=\"http://www.swapmeetdave.com/Humor/Cats/WithHat.htm\"
  title=\"you know you want to click it\"> cats</a>.\n\nThat's good for reddit. For
  them it means mainstream success.  reddit's also starting to hemorrhage users because
  nothing on their front page is new anymore.  They've managed to compile a looping
  \"greatest hits\" of the internet, but that's it, the end of the game, nothing new
  under the sun.\n\nSo instead of hitting reddit for the new and amusing, I started
  hitting RSS feeds instead.  Oh, RSS. I love RSS with a passion. It is a fine technology.
  \ Every day my inbox is flooded with a hundred articles, many of them fresh and
  relevant to my interests. \n\nSo there are blogs, which are original sources of
  technical information, and magazines, most of them staffed by the technically savvy.
  The magazine-blogs read everything and post it immediately, vast filters who produce
  reams of information that is relevant to your interests.  BoingBoing is the big
  fish in this pond- every day it's a flood of the best of the internet, annotated
  with clever writing.  What you're reading is maybe 10 people reading everything
  on the internet every day and posting their favourite bits.  Most of Wired's blogs
  and feeds feel the same way.\n\nThese feeds are not successful because they do the
  reporting themselves.  These feeds are successful because they stay on top of everything
  on the internet and only post the best links that they can find - hot and fresh
  and delivered right to your browser.  It's like a reddit, but instead of a mob of
  cat-hungry jackasses, it's a paid staff, and they find a lot of really good stuff.\n\nIn
  fact, that's what my new project, <a href=\"http://potater.com\">Potater</a>, is
  all about.  It's just me reading as many blogs as I can handle, filtering out the
  good bits, and serving them up at the end of the day like a hot platter of steaming
  news.\n\nI like it, I'm having a lot of fun with the Potater project.  If you'll
  excuse my expression, though, it's ... well, <em>small potaters</em>.  It's sort
  of a just-me-havin'-fun project.  \n\nAnd for most people who understand RSS feeds,
  they aren't going to just let me do the filtering for them. Instead, they are going
  to add me to their burgeoning list of RSS feeds.  The trick is just that I might
  be subscribed to something that they are not. I have <em>even more</em> interesting
  links for people who have interests along my lines.\n\nIn my opinion, the new lifeblood
  of the internet is not in publishing.  Publishing is cheap-as-free.  Blogging, images,
  comics, videos, whatever a user has to offer, there's a way to get it on the internet
  for free or almost free.  Because of it, the entire publishing industry is starting
  to fall on it's ass.  When anybody can publish something for ten bucks a month and
  push it to ten thousand users directly, what's the point of going through a distribution
  company?  They just need some sort of monetization model and they're good to go.
  \n\nNo, traditional publishing is dead, or at least it will be soon.  Newspapers,
  scientific publications, music distributors, even the big movie and television distributors
  are going to lose out eventually.\n\nBut this creates new problems.  People aren't
  getting paid for the content that they create.  There's no quality control on the
  internet.\n\nThese are the two big problems, now that distribution is out of the
  way - the people who used to be in charge of these things were the editors.  These
  are people who used to be paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to sit in
  a room and read everything that came their way.  They'd short list the good stuff,
  arrange it all in a neat and tidy little package, hire people to take pictures,
  have it typeset and nicely designed and copy-edited, and then sell that as a book
  or a magazine or a compact disc. \n\nAnd these middle men were undeniably getting
  fat off of the contributions of the people who were actually producing the good
  stuff.\n\nBut the gravy train is starting to come to an end.  Publication on the
  internet is free. There's no need to work with these massive arbiters of the public
  taste.  \n\nAnd lo and behold, with the internet comes a flowering of niches that
  were underserved by these publications.  Fanfic, hot-off-the-press technical news,
  cartoonists - oh BOY were cartoonists fucked over by the original system - all of
  these were people who just didn't get a piece of the pie the 'old way' - it's no
  wonder that they're leading the charge in the free publishing world.\n\nHere I am,
  sitting, looking at a copy of <a href=\"http://cacm.acm.org/\">Communications of
  the ACM</a> that I've just received in the mail.  It is stunning.  Full colour,
  beautifully typeset, full of imagery, free of ads, and totally relevant to my interests.
  \ It has articles about search engines and MapReduce and triple-parity RAID and
  streaming SQL technology and a computing museum; articles about how biology lacks
  proper standards, business of software articles, and about recent research in x86
  sandboxing.  No ads, even. \n\nI'm not saying there's not a market for this kind
  of thing.  This magazine is magnificent. It's also expensive, and monthly. There's
  a new space out there, a space where news is instant and unfiltered and raw, and
  the new champions of this space are the BoingBoings, the TechCrunches, the reddits
  - the sites which act as the new magazines, deciders of taste, compilers of internet
  goodness. \n\nThis is the unexplored territory, a rich territory, the battlefield
  upon which the new publication battles of the 21st century will be fought.\n\nAnd
  RSS is where it all happens. \n\n---------------------\n\nSo, we return to my original
  point.  Reddit is great, because it's community-filtered, but it's terrible, because
  the news is stale and the user base is starting to get tragedy-of-the-commons stupid.
  \n\nOn the other hand, e-Magazines like BoingBoing and Wired are great, because
  they're hand-filtered, fresh, and relevant, but because of the manpower required,
  they don't serve niche markets effectively and they bleed money.  On top of that,
  they run out of news really quickly, and they rarely filter through the reams upon
  reams of excellent self-published material out there. (BoingBoing is pretty great,
  mind you, but there's only so much BoingBoing to go around, and it's quite the info-flood,
  still.)\n\nNow, gentlemen, perhaps you are starting to get the gist of what I am
  proposing. Community-powered RSS-filtering. Each 'channel' is a package of RSS feeds,
  managed by a single person, or a small group, or publicly. My personal channel might
  be all of the feeds that go into the making of Potater.  Our group channel might
  be an amalgam of all of the coolest tech and vancouver news that we can find.  A
  public channel might cover a broader topic, like 'technology' or 'Ruby blogs'. \n\nAs
  these channels flow, flush to bursting with all of the data that they contain, individual
  users flag individual posts with 'notability' markers.  \"I really like this\".
  \"I like this.\"  \"I hate this. \" (etc..) The notability markers affect the real-time
  view of the data - heavily liked items appear larger, they glow and pulsate with
  the energy of attention. Heavily disliked items fade into obscurity, both literally
  and figuratively.  \n\nWhen items reach certain notability thresholds - the feed-consumer,
  the end-user, might decide the flow ('N links/day' or 'N links/hour'), which would
  translate into a notability requirement that the user wouldn't see ('5 upvotes')
  - when the items reach these thresholds, then they get plunked into the \"output\"
  feeds, which can then be 'input' feeds for other groups or users (or just end up
  directly in somebody's feed-reader.)  Either that or the feed publishers can just
  set their own notability thresholds.\n\nThese links can come out raw, or annotated
  - so a small, clever group, a BoingBoing, they could gather, annotate, and re-publish
  a ball of feeds every day. For public feeds, the annotations would be more along
  the lines of a community discussion.  Perhaps the discussion itself would constitute
  a feed of it's own.\n\nThis is still in a fuzzy sort of design phase, but this is
  the direction that I want to take Potater. \n\nI even assembled an imaginary A-Team
  of people who I'd want to work on Potater with, and then mentally assigned them
  powers from the Planeteers. Because I can. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.antipode.ca/\">Allen</a>,
  with the power of Fire, a tech-blogger, a feed-reader, an Apple engineer, a tireless
  advocate of the entrepreneurial spirit, a battle-hardened coder, a front-end man.
  \n\n<a href=\"http://yangman.ca/\">Yangman</a>, with the power of Water, a fucking-prolific-hacker,
  a pythonista, an expirimenter with everything that nobody's ever heard of, and a
  sexy-beast, to boot. \n\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/cdemwell\">Demwell</a>, with
  the power of Wind, with business chops and technical prowess in equal measure, with
  natural language processing and distributed systems experience, and a beard that
  just won't quit. \n\nand \n\nME, with the power of Earth, because <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deprecation\">I
  take forever to do anything and weigh a fucking ton</a>. Also I can code and design
  some.  Write a bit.  Forge tools from stone to harvest simple grains. That sort
  of thing.  I could build this sort of thing on my own, but I have the awful tendency
  to get super-excited about a project, do a tonne of planning and preliminary code,
  and then lose interest and fall asleep in some bushes.  This is why I need other
  people to help push things forward! \n\nI hesitate to hand out the power of Heart,
  because it's <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway\">a
  super-lame power</a>.  I'd have nominated <a href=\"http://ironoxide.ca/\">Danly</a>
  for that specific honor, but apparently he's under a no-compete/NDA so restrictive
  as to render him useless for side-projects. Curse you, danly's source of funding!
  \n\nDon't feel bad if you're not on the list. I still think that <em>you</em> are
  awesome, and I would have included you if I didn't run out of Captain Planet themed
  powers.  I mean, I could hand out the bad-guy names, but who wants to be <a href=\"http://www.turner.com/planet/static/looten.html\">Looten
  Plunder</a>?  \n\nWait, can I change my power to \"Being Looten Plunder\"? \n\nSo,
  tell me what you think of this ill-defined masterpiece.  Throw ideas.  Throw poop
  if necessary.  Not too much poop.  Keep poop-throwing to a manageable level. Please.
