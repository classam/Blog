  />\n\nThere is no way to kill a good 20 minutes (or longer) than playing <a title=\"Orisinal's
  Winterbells\" href=\"http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bells.htm\">Winterbells</a>.\n\nCan
  you beat my high-score? It's 42,725,700. \n\n<a title=\"Orisinal: Morning Sunshine\"
  href=\"http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/\">Ferry Halim's 'Orisinal' games</a>
  are some of the most beautiful, well-thought out, and fun (sometimes) flash games
  on the internet. They're friendly, relaxing games that kill stress... unless you're
  moments away from a high score. Some of the games lack too much of a gameplay mechanic,
  but I would recommend <a href=\"http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bugs.htm\">Bugs</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/floats.htm\">Floats</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/high.htm\">High
  Delivery</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g2/bubble.htm\">Bubble
  Bees</a>.\n\nOf course, these games are cute, stress-reducing games with little
  thought, new-age piano music and cute characters..\nOn the exact opposite end of
  the scale, there's <a href=\"http://onslaught2.fizzlebot.com/\">Onslaught 2</a>..
  and to give your brain a squeeze, <a href=\"http://www.planarity.net/#\">Planarity</a>.\n\n(Warning:
  Your nerdish tendencies to organize everything will cause Planarity to eat your
  soul.)\n"
