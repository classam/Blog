  Dylan ( Everything in its right place.) says:

  let’s make a comic about the trash can robot

  Dylan ( Everything in its right place.) says:

  that thanks you for your garbage

  Curtis - says:

  “Thank you!”

  ..

  ..

  “Wait.. are you leaving?”

  ..

  “I… I love you!”

  Dylan ( Everything in its right place.) says:

  more like, a character i disturbed by the nature of it and believes it will lead
  to horrible things

  Dylan ( Everything in its right place.) says:

  and then sometime in the future that guy gets off a toilet

  Dylan ( Everything in its right place.) says:

  and the toilet thanks him for his poop

  Dylan ( Everything in its right place.) says:

  and gives him dietary advice

  Dylan ( Everything in its right place.) says:

  and also enjoys the poop a little too much

  Curtis - says:

  “Thank you.”


  “Mmmmmm.”


  “You could use a little more fibre, there, captain. “


  <strong>Note</strong>: I actually drew Dylan''s version, but then I left the sketchbook
  at a Subway. So, it''s my version instead. Ha. '
