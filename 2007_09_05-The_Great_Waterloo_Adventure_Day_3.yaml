  />\n\nThe rest of the orientation was pretty slow. More presentations on boring
  legal matters- \"If anybody learns anything about your job, we'll kill you and all
  of your family\", that sort of thing. Given the strong warnings they've posted,
  I'll not go into specifics about what I actually *do* here- fortunately, I don't
  really know what that is, yet. \n\nAfter the orientation, I wandered home, finished
  my half-eaten pizza, and chilled out on the couch playing Super Paper Mario some
  more.  I'll defeat you yet, game! \n\nAfter a brief nap, I was ready to go out and
  show the town who's boss. (It's me)  I pulled on some pants and walked with Mike
  to Sobey's (a grocery store). I surfed about the store, buying every non-meat supply
  required to make spaghetti sauce.  Spices are expensive! I also picked up a newer,
  better frying pan- it's slightly larger, and the teflon is unmarred! I was unable
  (as yet) to find a laundry hamper, bins, a cutting board, or a large-enough-pasta-makin'-pot-
  My next trip will be Conestoga Mall, and it's Zellers. If I can handle that in a
  timely manner, it's pasta for me, tonight! \n\nI ended up spending $85 on groceries,
  leaving me $205 left for the next 17 days of food. I'm sure I can eat for 2 weeks
  on $200, right? If I make lots of sauce out of those supplies I just bought, maybe.
  (Oh, and I need containers, too. Lots of them.)\n\nThen, sleep.\n\nWoke up this
  morning, showered, shaved with that ridiculous 6-bladed vibrating Fusion razor that
  Uncle Antonio gave me.. and it worked like a charm. Smoothest shave I've ever had.
  6 blades still seem a little excessive, but hey- they're free!\n\nDressed up, walked
  to work- it only takes about 15-20 minutes to walk to work. First thing, I was sat
  down at a desk, given a name/password, a BlackBerry, and instructions to read everything
  I can from the company wiki.\n\nMy desk is beautiful.  It's about as big as half
  of my bedroom at home. I have 2 monitors, both of which are huge and bright- I think
  a 21\" and a 19\".  The computer is a Core 2 @ 2.13Ghz with 100Gb of RAM. I have
  my own phone, two big-ass drawers, and a whiteboard.  I have a little engraved metal
  dealy with my name on it, velcroed to the wall. I could fit half of MovieSet's downstairs
  'offices' in here. I love it.\n\nAlso beautiful? My BlackBerry- it's an 8700, the
  newest model on the market.  It's brand spankin' new- I'm the first user.  It has
  voice, expandable memory, and I can use it to surf the internet.  I spent my entire
  lunch hour playing with it, reading my website and Coding Horror and what-have-you.
  \ \n\nSo, I went out for lunch at the Chinese restaurant halfway between my house
  and RIM. Service was slow, food had no taste whatsoever, and the chow-mein was 100%
  sprouts. Bleh. \n\nI've read everything on the training wiki, so I'm going to bother
  my manager for more instructions. See you all later!"
