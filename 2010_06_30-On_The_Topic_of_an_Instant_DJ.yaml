  articles expound endlessly on a topic that is completely and utterly ridiculous.</em>\n\nGood
  afternoon, the internet. I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of MCing, DJing, and
  ACing, have just experienced a revelation in tunes.\n\nSo, the ever talented-and-ambitious
  <a href=\"http://www.antipode.ca/\">Allen Pike</a> is attempting to strike out on
  his own, leaving <del>the Apple sweatshop</del> his safe and secure job to take
  a chance on <a title=\"Steamclock Software\" href=\"http://www.steamclocksoftware.com/\">founding
  his own software company</a> and/or eating shoe-leather in order to survive. \n\nHis
  current project is a DJ control-centre app for the iPhone, so that cash-strapped
  young techies can run the tunes at their own weddings. This allows for such convenient
  features as 'MC stops', 'Repeat avoidance', and of course, the much-vaunted 'Micheal
  Buble Filter'.\n\nWe were chatting about it at a wedding, and we stumbled upon the
  problem of what makes good dance music.  I'm sure that you may have experienced
  that moment on a dance floor when a<a title=\"Wierd Al - Amish Paradise\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOfZLb33uCg\">
  totally undanceable song</a> comes up and everybody just walks back to their table.
  \ \n\nSomebody suggested the \"Rescue Me!\" sort of button, a large red button that,
  upon being pressed, would immediately purchase and launch a highly danceable set
  of emergency tunes.  It's a good idea, but it made me think about the problems inherent
  in playing tunes at an event with dancing. \n\n<h3>Problem: Your Playlist is Undanceable</h3>\nTake
  an arbitrary person.  We will name this person <em>Jonathan Corbin Mustardhands
  IV</em>. Jon might think that it is a good idea to DJ for his own wedding.  He has
  lot of music on his iPod - good music - he listens to it every day on the way to
  work.  He wants to share his musical choices with his friends and family.\n\nThis
  works well enough during the pre-game show - Jon takes a few precautions, makes
  sure that nothing <a title=\"Nine Inch Nails - Closer\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVgBuwM9zcQ\">inappropriate</a>
  comes up before the ceremony. \n\nBut when the dance floor opens up, Jon's music
  falls flat.  Some of his music is poppy enough to get people on the floor, but <em>it
  just takes one undanceable song to totally clear the floor</em>, so it's hard to
  maintain <strong>dance critical mass</strong>. \n\n<h3>Problem: A Wedding is Not
  a Club</h3>\nSome people might take their wedding dance music cues from the club
  scene - and this is a good first step, because these clubs select songs with high
  danceability, and then (semi)talented DJs massage these songs into even further
  funkocity using enormous speakers and a unifying, driving beat.\n\nBut clubs are
  not weddings.  These are people, unified in genre selection and demographic, nigh
  inexhaustible, who have come out for a night of sexually charged dance moves and
  substance abuse.  This is almost the complete opposite of a wedding crowd, a mismatched
  group of people who have just eaten their own weight in gravy-laden potatoes and
  are reluctant to show off their 15-year-old dance moves to an already judgemental
  crowd. \n\n<h3>Danceability</h3>\n\nLet's create some criteria for <em>Danceability</em>.
  \ We shall measure Danceability in a standardized unit, and name it after a groundbreaking
  discovery in the field of body-movin' - the 'Thriller'.  Notably, the song \"Thriller\"
  scores at a staggering 2.98 KiloThrillers, making it individually powerful enough
  to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMnk7lh9M3o\">infect an entire prison</a>.
  \n\nOf course, Danceability is more granular than that - the formula for Thrillers
  is as follows:\n\n<blockquote>D = B^2 + r + c </blockquote>\n\nOr, in layman's terms,
  Danceability = Beat Squared + Recognition + Cheese\n\n<h3>Cheese</h3>\nAlso known
  as Camp, the \"Cheese\" factor of a song is surprisingly important.  Dancing is
  a fundamentally silly activity, and in order to get people who have been drinking
  and wearing starchy suits to feel comfortable waving their arms about in the air,
  songs must be selected with a certain inherent silliness. \n\nSongs with a high
  cheese factor help people get over the initial hump of getting on to the dance floor.\n\nGood
  examples include <a title=\"Right Said Fred - I'm Too Sexy\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39YUXIKrOFk\">I'm
  Too Sexy</a>, <a title=\"Tom Jones - Sex Bomb\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KUJE2xs-RE\">Sex
  Bomb</a>, <a title=\"Carl Douglas - Kung-Fu Fighting\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhUkGIsKvn0\">Kung-Fu
  Fighting</a>, <a title=\"Wild Cherry - Play that Funky Music\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe1ScoePqVA\">Play
  that Funky Music</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvDMlk3kSYg\">Ra-Ra-Rasputin</a>,
  or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbt30UnzRWw\">Whip It</a>. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN_YjM4V4fc\">Paradise
  by the Dashboard Light</a> isn't inherently ridiculous, but its sheer inappropriateness
  for a wedding shoot it straight into Cheese territory. \n\nThe Chicken Dance and
  YMCA both score off the charts on the Cheese scale. They exist in dangerous, uncharted
  territory, where Cheese has taken over. \n\nSome songs have a dangerously low Cheese
  level.  Daft Punk songs, <a title=\"Daft Punk - One More Time\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH-0s0pRleg\">for
  example</a>, have excellent Beat and decent Recognition, but score abysmally on
  the Cheese scale because they just take themselves so seriously.  This doesn't mean
  that you shouldn't play them, just that you should be careful to keep Cheese levels
  high.\n\n<h3>Beat</h3>\nIn order to be danceable, a song needs to have a beat appropriate
  for dancin'. You may be familiar with such beats as \"OONTS OONTS OONTS\" and \"dum-CHIK
  dum-CHIK dum-CHIK\", but there are many other danceable beats. \n\nSongs need a
  good, solid backbeat for people to get their rhythm on.  Strong percussion and strong
  repetition.  Club DJs don't need a Cheese factor, so they take songs with high Recognition
  and good Beat, and then use top-secret DJ Techniques (\"see: OONTS OONTS OONTS\")
  to push the Beat as high as possible.\n\nSongs with good Beat can be <a title=\"Lady
  Gaga - Poker Face\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht8ZjuFzlUc\">new</a>,
  or <a title=\"J. Geils Band - Centerfold\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqDjMZKf-wg\">old</a>,
  <a title=\"Culture Beat - Mr. Vain\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvgUdrzGNys\">drum
  machine</a> or <a title=\"Basshunter - Now You're Gone\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgFwiCApH7E\">drum
  machine</a>, <a title=\"Daft Punk - Harder Better Faster Stronger (Alive 2007)\"
  href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ItqVgaTIjI&feature=fvw\">Daft Punk</a> or
  <a title=\"Kylie Minogue - In Your Eyes\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbO2mb_sYsA\">Kylie
  Minogue</a>, so long as you can snap in time with the music. \n\n<a title=\"MC Hammer
  - U Can't Touch This\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otCpCn0l4Wo&feature=channel\">U
  Can't Touch This</a> has high Cheese and high Recognition, but absolutely fails
  the Beat test. Try to nod your head along with the music. Just try.  The tune proceeds
  at a different pace to the beat, so it's disorienting, it doesn't work well.\n\nSongs
  that lack Beat kill dances. If people can't move to something, they won't.   <a
  title=\"Cake - Shadow Stabbing\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa52P9fCUP0\">Cake</a>
  songs lack a danceable beat.  \n\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\nThis is a measure of how
  familiar the crowd is with the music that's being played.  Songs with a well-known,
  easy-to-perform signature move (Thriller, the Chicken Dance, the Macarena), score
  very highly on the Recognition scale.\n\nRecognition is one of the hardest to nail
  down, because every crowd has a different demographic mix, and every person has
  a different taste in music.  Some groups might love R&B, some Classic Rock.  Some
  guests might love <a title=\"Aqua - Candyman\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM-Mk26N6wQ\">Norwegian
  Bubblegum Pop</a> to the exclusion of all else.  These guests are dangerous and
  you should keep your distance. \n\nThanks to the aforementioned effects, songs with
  high Cheese levels and reasonably good Beat are also wedding favourites, which make
  them very Recognizable. \n\n<h3> Slow Dance Songs </h3>\n\nOh, and we can't forget
  Slow Dance songs, a whole world unto themselves.  They need to be slow and romantic,
  and there are few other requirements.  A good thing to avoid is songs that sound
  romantic, until you listen closer to the lyrics and realize that<a title=\"I don't
  know why I thought that this was a romantic song in the first place.\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy4FXhkm6Nw&feature=channel\">
  they are not</a>. \n\n<h3> Conclusion </h3> \n\nIn conclusion, you have learned
  nothing and wasted your time following countless links to terrible, terrible songs.
  I win. "
