  \ Popcorn? Burned. Dumpling soup? Too lemony, not oniony enough. Heck, my last frozen-perogies-from-a-bag
  were kind of boring, even.  \n\nBut today, I'm three for three.  I started by putting
  a brine together.  A half cup of salt, a full cup of brown sugar, mustard powder,
  and black pepper, in a bowl, and then hot apple cider vinegar poured over the thing.
  \ Mix it up, give it some time to dissolve.  Throw in two racks of ice, and shake
  a bit to cool it all down.  Bam, brine. \n\nThen, I tossed some pork chops in the
  brine. Just let them sit there and soak up flavor and juiciness.\n\nLater? I got
  hungry.  Chicken broth with green onions, fresh ground ginger, garlic, soy sauce,
  and rice noodles.  It needed meat, so I fetched one of the half-brined chops, sliced
  it into convenient little strips, fried it up, and tossed it in the soup.  Verdict?
  Delicious. \n\nEven later still? I fried up a full chop.  Flavorful, juicy, and
  delicious. \n\nAnd then? Popcorn in a pot.  My last two attempts at popcorn used
  a stock pot and fairly low heat, and the popcorn ended up being not-quite-burned-but-definitely-pretty-overdone.
  \ This time, I used a much smaller pot at a much higher heat.  The smaller pot,
  while offering a decreased popcorn payload, was easier to 'shake' over the element...
  and the popcorn came out fluffy and perfect. Nice. Three for three, baby."
