  />\n\nFailing to eat sushi the Japanese way will earn you the scorn of your foes
  and the pity of your friends. Your acquaintances will remain neutral towards you,
  but with a certain steely glint in their eyes that will suggest that they just don't
  have that same respect for you that they once did.\n\nWorry not, though, I'm here
  to tell you everything you need to know about eating sushi.. the Japanese way!\n\nFirst
  of all, chopsticks.  It turns out, real Japanese people don't actually use the chopsticks.
  They just leave them at the table, pristine and untouched, for the entire meal.
  \ It is considered extremely unsophisticated to use or even touch the chopsticks.
  \ Instead, it is considered customary to eat the sushi with your fingers, or bring
  a plastic fork from a nearby food court.\n\nWhile you may not understand the Japanese
  language, it's considered polite to address the waitress (or \"yaki mochi\") in
  whatever Japanese you might know.  The proper greeting when you are sitting in a
  sushi restaurant is \"Tenisu O Shimasu Ka!\", preferably at the top of your lungs.
  \ This will put your server at ease and prepare you for the rest of your meal.\n\nWhen
  ordering, instead of trying to mangle the Japanese names that you see on the menu
  (\"I would like to order the Ne.. Ki.. Po... Chi.. Hombre Lobo?\"), or seeming unsophisticated
  by using the American names (\"One Big Fatty-Jim Roll, please.\"), you should just
  gesture frantically at the items on the menu that you want to eat.  You could also
  circle the items on the menu that you want to purchase in bright red pen.\n\nWhen
  ordering, remember that there are a number of different types of sushi.  First of
  all, there's \"Nigiri\", which is the Japanese word for 'slippery'.  It's a small
  fillet of some protein (usually steak), served on top of a tiny ball of rice.  To
  eat Nigiri properly, remove the ball of rice from the center and save it on your
  plate, then eat the fillet.  Slowly, don't just rudely slurp it down- you should
  eat it like a chipmunk, with many very quick bites one after the other. Once you
  have six or seven balls of rice on your plate, stack them into a pyramid. This is
  your way of signaling to your waitress that you would like some more.  Should you
  want to try something else, or finish your meal you should instead take the balls
  of rice and use them to spell out an 'X'. \n\nThere's also \"Maki\", which is the
  Japanese word for Maki. This will traditionally be a roll that is quite delicious.
  Real sushi fans will tell you to avoid the California rolls- they are for people
  who are inexperienced with sushi eating. This is why I dislike 'real sushi fans'-
  they're total dicks. \n\nOrder maki by the dozen, or bushel.  \"One bushel of maki,
  please!\" you can say. When the maki arrives at your table, eat it by gripping a
  single roll firmly between thumb and forefinger, tossing the maki in the air, yelling
  \"OHAYOU!\", and catching it in your mouth. Wash it down with a swig of soy-sauce
  and a whole ball of wasabi.\n\nThe pickled ginger is not to be eaten at all, it
  is to be worn like a little hat.\n\nUpon leaving, remember that the waitresses take
  great pride in their work. To tip with money would be disrespectful. Instead, on
  the way out, do a happy little jig to indicate that you've thoroughly enjoyed both
  the meal and the service.\n\nSo, now you know how to eat sushi like a real Japanese
  person.  Good luck, good eating, and... Tenisu O Shimasu Ka!"
