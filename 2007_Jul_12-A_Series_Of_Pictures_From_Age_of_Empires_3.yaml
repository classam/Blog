  />\nOkay, so anybody who might have read about my <a title=\"Nobody Wants To Hear
  You Talk About Gaming\" href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=228\">Secret Love
  Affair With Age of Empires 2</a> a short while ago, might have thought.. \"But Age
  Of Empires 3 is out!\".\n\nWell, I came to that same conclusion and thought out
  of sheer curiosity that I might try Age Of Empires 3.\n\nBig Mistake.\n\nWhat I
  played was not really Age Of Empires 3, but the much less entertaining game, \"A
  Slideshow Featuring A Series Of Concurrent Pictures Of Age Of Empires 3\". \n\nAt
  times, my FPS dipped below 1.  I could honestly go and get a cup of coffee in the
  time it took for a naval battle to occur. \n\nWe're not talking about on maximum
  graphics settings, here, either. I had the game's options set to what amounts to
  \"1992\". The game looked uglier than the original Tribes with those settings, and
  here it is still choking on every available step.\n\nI've come to the conclusion
  that if I want to play awesome computer-style games, I'm going to need a 'rig'.
  \ Being that I'm not going to have any 'rig' money in the near future, it's probably
  going to be a dream for when I have a stable job of my own.\n\nUp until then, I
  have to ask you all. (All 4 of you) \n\nWhat are awesome multiplayer games that
  were released between about 2001 and 2003-2004? Games that can be run by a computer
  with (essentially) a graphics card designed to run nothing at all?\n\nI'm thinking
  the \"Total War\" series might be it. "
