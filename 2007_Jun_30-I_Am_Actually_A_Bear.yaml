  <blockquote style="padding-left:10px;font-size:90%;">I lost my virginity first semester
  freshman year. The guy I was with was always sending his friend instant messages
  from his computer bragging how I was a lady in the street but a tiger in the sack.
  I said, "I am not a tiger in the sack; I am a bear all the time." He just laughed
  at that, and said he liked how kinky I was, so I said, "You don''t understand me
  at all." He said, "all women say that to me, but it''s not true, baby." And I said,
  "I am not a woman though, I am a bear." He said we were just really different, but
  that was okay. I repeated, "we are really different, but that is because I am a
  bear."


  He just laughed really rudely and I felt patronized so I mauled him and left without
  saying goodbye. Love hurts.</blockquote>
