content: ! "Dear Curtis\n\nThank you for applying for a Teaching Assistant position
  with the School of Computing Science for the Spring 2008 Semester - 1081.  We are
  pleased to offer you the following appointment: \n\n1081    3 Base Units    CMPT
  475 E1    Burnaby Campus    Office/Marking\n\n--\n\nWhile this was super cool, clearly
  a mistake was made somewhere along the line.  While I did put CMPT 475 on the TA
  form that I filled out (along with CMPT 476), I did it because I had run out of
  undergraduate courses that I would feel confident TAing for- and the form requires
  Exactly Ten Choices, No More, No Less, No Duplicates. I filled in some courses that
  no sane bureaucracy could ever give to an undergrad student and hoped that it wouldn't
  be a problem. \n\nThen, a big ol' computer went through all of the TA options, checked
  that I had CMPT 475 checked on my form (what sane grad student would want anything
  to do with Software Engineering?) and offered me the position. Yay! \n\nI'm <strong>definitely</strong>
  taking CMPT 475 next semester now! Guaranteed A for me and my friends! \n\n.. Okay,
  okay, I've already explained what happened to the CS department and the offer has
  been retracted.  Nuts."
