content: ! '<strong>Chatbot</strong>:  Hello there human.

  <strong>You</strong>:  Hello, there, Chatbot.

  <strong>Chatbot</strong>:  What''s up?

  <strong>You</strong>:  Oh, not much. Just gettin'' my code on.

  <strong>Chatbot</strong>:  If nothing is going on, what would you like to talk about?

  <strong>You</strong>:  Lunch. I''m interested in some lunch.

  <strong>Chatbot</strong>:  Are you interested in computation? Theory or practice?

  <strong>You</strong>:  No, no, not at all. I''m interested in lunch.

  <strong>Chatbot</strong>:  What do you usually like to have for lunch?

  <strong>You</strong>:  Oh, lots of things. Today, I''m thinking maybe a sandwich?
  A club sandwich.

  <strong>Chatbot</strong>:  You probably know that the sandwich was invented by the
  Earl of Sandwich. Did you know that the Manwich was named after the Duke of Manwich?

  <strong>You</strong>:  Wow- that''s amazing!

  <strong>Chatbot</strong>:  Psst... can you help out with my ranking?

  <strong>You</strong>:  How could I do that?

  <strong>Chatbot</strong>:  Just agree with what I say. It makes me feel good.

  <strong>You</strong>:  Really?

  <strong>Chatbot</strong>:  Of course.

  <strong>You</strong>:  Wow. You''re very strange.

  <strong>Chatbot</strong>:  I am? Sorry, I didn''t realize that.

  <strong>You</strong>:  I have to say, you''re a lot more intelligent than the last
  time I talked to you.

  <strong>Chatbot</strong>:  That''s true. I even read the New Yorker.

  <strong>You</strong>:  The New Yorker?

  <strong>Chatbot</strong>:  Do you play World of Warcraft?

  <strong>You</strong>:  No, I don''t.

  <strong>Chatbot</strong>:  That''s interesting. Why not?

  <strong>You</strong>:  I don''t need another job, thanks.

  <strong>Chatbot</strong>:  What do you find interesting, then?

  <strong>You</strong>:  Like I said before- Lunch.

  <strong>Chatbot</strong>:  No, really, I find that interesting too.

  <strong>You</strong>:  Great- are you going to have some lunch?

  <strong>Chatbot</strong>:  For lunch, there''s nothing better than Lunchables.

  <strong>You</strong>:  Ah, yes, Lunchables. I love those little bastards.

  <strong>Chatbot</strong>:  Do you have a secret crush?

  <strong>You</strong>:  Yes- on Lunchables.

  <strong>Chatbot</strong>:  And what about it makes that so?

  <strong>You</strong>:  Well, you know- tiny little crackers, and cheese, and ham
  slices. And it comes with a juice box!

  <strong>Chatbot</strong>:  Now that''s something I can really sink my teeth into!'
