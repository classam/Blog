content: ! 'I''ve been sick for the last two days (explaining both the long, feverish
  blog posts and the short nonsensical ones)- with a simple cold. You know, headaches,
  snuffles, strange oozes. There''s nothing that dastardly amounts of sleep, tea,
  and powerful drugs can''t do- I''m feeling better already!


  Today, I saw a clock saying "4:04" when I made my breakfast (Hey, I woke up at 2:00,
  cut me some slack) and I thought "Hey! 404! Heh heh. The time server''s down! Somebody
  call up Greenwich and tell them to get tech support down there!"


  Yeah, I''m a dork.'
