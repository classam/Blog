  articles expound endlessly on a topic that is completely and utterly ridiculous.</em>\n\nGood
  afternoon, the internet. I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of gentlemanly beverages,
  have just enjoyed a steaming mug of morning ambrosia.\n\nWell, it was really more
  'afternoon ambrosia'. My morning was almost entirely consumed by meetings, as would
  be expected of a soulless corporate drone such as myself. \n\nThis tea was especially
  sweet, because yesterday, I failed at morning tea. I failed at all possible tea
  metrics. There was no recoverable deliciousness. \n\nThe morning was, of course,
  dominated by training meetings.  We're learning why Data Architecture exists, from
  a Dutch man who was programming in COBOL back before computers existed.  I made
  my tea, and left it behind, distracted by <em>more meetings</em>.\n\nSo, that was
  an initial tea fail. Cold tea is no good.  I thought, 'hey, I'll microwave this
  into palatability', forgetting that my travel mug was forged out of what could only
  be described as a solid sheet of stainless steel.  The explosion, and resulting
  stench of burning plastic, was noticeable throughout the entire department.  \n\nI
  tried making tea in the shattered wreckage of my old tea mug. It just tasted like
  metal and failure. I had to discard the whole sordid failure-pile that had once
  been my morning routine. \n\nThe whole compound fail that was my tea of yesterday,
  however, just made today's tea all the more sweet.  Well, that and the six or seven
  teaspoons full of sugar."
