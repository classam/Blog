content: ! "I love you, Kristen!\n\nThis is written in Tomboy- Tomboy is a 'note-taking
  program'.  You can pop up little notes like this one, group notes together, search-through
  them and even link them together.  \n\nHere's a quick intro to the computer...\n\n<h3>
  Software </h3>\n\nPidgin Internet Messenger is like MSN Messenger- except it works
  with AIM, IRC, Yahoo! Messenger, and any other messenging protocol that you can
  think of. \n\nText Editor is just like Windows' \"Notepad\", but with a lot more
  features and functionality (like tabs).  It's useful for quick notes to yourself
  and for me (if I'm coding). \n\nThe \"Terminal\" is a way for you to enter text
  commands directly to your OS- sort of like DOS in Windows, but (again) with a lot
  more features and functionality.  You'll find that I almost always have a Terminal
  open when I'm coding on the Mac.   I don't expect you to familiarize yourself with
  the terminal- but if you go to the internet for Ubuntu help, and they tell you to
  enter a command... this is where you would enter it. \n \nOpenOffice.org Word Processor
  is the open-source world's answer to Word.  It can read and write Word documents
  fine- although it lacks Word's more advanced features.  I've configured your OpenOffice
  to always save files in a Word XP compatible format. (Although .odf is a better
  format, you're not likely to care. )\n\nOpenOffice.org Presentation is the PPT equivalent,
  and OpenOffice.org Spreadsheet is the Excel equivalent.  They've both been instructed
  to always save in an Excel/Powerpoint compatible format.\n\nSunbird is a calendar
  developed by the same people who designed Firefox.\n\nEvolution is the Ubuntu equivalent
  to Outlook/Outlook Express - It'll handle e-mail and it also provides a calendar
  and some other work tools.  \n\nAudacity is a sound-editing software package (You
  might remember it from IAT 100?)\n\nThe Audio CD Extractor is a method for converting
  CD's into mp3's.\n\nThe Brasero Disc Burner is a ... CD Burner. YAAAY.\n\nSongbird
  is the Ubuntu equivalent to iTunes- once again by the same people who designed FireFox.\n\nThe
  computer comes with Rhythmbox, too, which is another alternative to iTunes. \n\nAnd
  finally, Wine is an elaborately constructed Windows simulator- which will (occasionally)
  allow you to install a Windows program to your computer.  Getting things working
  takes a bit of fiddling, though, and it isn't always pretty. \n\n<h3>Package Management</h3>\n\nYou
  know how you install programs in Windows?  Download a file, run it, follow the instructions,
  blah blah blah?\n\nWell, Ubuntu doesn't work that way. \n\nUbuntu uses a system
  called \"Package Management which is very simple.  The guys who run Ubuntu manage
  a \"Repository\", which is a huge list of all of the software that you can run under
  Ubuntu.  By opening up the Synaptic Package Manager (in \"System/Administration\"),
  you can see the whole list of all of the packages.\n\nNow, this list is (notably)
  quite confusing. It has libraries and programmer tools all mixed up with the actual
  programs, and it's hard to tell what's what. \n\nSo, to make it easier for people
  to use, there's also an Add/Remove programs link in \"Applications\".  Click on
  it, and it will give you a great big list of all of the graphical programs that
  you can run on your computer.  Just select the programs that you want or don't want,
  and Ubuntu will download and install them for you.\n\nYou'll note that a lot of
  the software in Add/Remove programs starts with a 'k' (Kopete, Kboot, Konsole),
  aren't installed- that's because they run under KDE. (What? What does that mean?)
  - Most Linux systems have two different graphics packages that allow nice graphical
  programs - Gnome and KDE - and Ubuntu uses Gnome.  If you look in the description
  for the programs, the Gnome programs have a little 'footprint', and the KDE programs
  have a little blue 'K'.   KDE programs will still run fine in Ubuntu, but they're
  a lot slower (so keep that in mind.)\n\nNext to the time, there's a link to the
  Ubuntu \"Update Manager\"- this is a program responsible for keeping all of your
  Ubuntu packages up-to-date.  It's nice, because that means the only software updates
  you have to do- ever- are all handled by the Update Manager.\n\nAs a last-but-not-least,
  I (notice I said 'I', not 'you') can also install software by opening up the Terminal
  and using the 'apt-get' command.  It's a LOT faster than using Synaptic Package
  Manager, but less attractive.  (For example, to run the updates I mentioned before,
  'sudo apt-get update' is the command. )\n\n<h3>Places</h3>\n\nOnce again, Ubuntu's
  file-storage system doesn't work quite exactly the same way Windows's does.\n\nYou
  can get to just about anywhere on your computer from the Places menu (see the top
  of your screen).  Your \"Home Folder\" is quite possibly the most important place
  on the entire computer.  It contains all of the files on your desktop, all of your
  documents, some examples of Ubuntu files, your Music, your Pictures, your Videos,
  your Downloads, everything.\n\nYour \"Filesystem\" is like the C: drive in Windows-
  it's the root where everything sits.  It contains a bunch of cryptic folders, none
  of which you need to understand- bin (programs), boot( important files for booting
  up), cdrom (your cd drive)... etcetera, etcetera.  Long-story-short: Don't touch
  any of these, unless you're me.  \n\nAs an entirely unnecessary sidebar, your home
  folder resides in the location /home/kristen/ - Just like it might reside in C:/Documents
  and Settings/Kristen/ on your home computer.\n\nOkay, on to the easy stuff- when
  you insert a CD or a Hard Drive, they'll just appear on your Desktop. Ta Daaa!"
