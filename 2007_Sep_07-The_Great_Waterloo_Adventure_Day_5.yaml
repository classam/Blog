  />\n\nWell, the rest of the day was uneventful.  So far, I've managed to get access
  to the codebase and documents of the project I'll be working with.\n\nThe code is
  messy and the documentation is nil, but the program is small enough that I've been
  able to copy big chunks down as a series of flow-charts.  Soon, I'll be refactoring
  and adding such programming 'classics' as functions and even classes (*gasp*).  If
  I'm lucky, by the time I have a meeting with my boss to discuss how familiar I am
  with the codebase, I'll have rewritten the core elements of the program.\n\nThat
  more or less covers what I've done at work last 2 days- trying to understand the
  program that I'll be working on and trying to get a handle on the tools that I'll
  be working with.  When it comes down to it, Perforce is not the SubVersion that
  I'm so (almost) familiar with, Windows Server bears no resemblance to the Ubuntu
  servers that I so love, and MS SQL Server is just ever-so-slightly different from
  MySQL. \n\nLast night, I came home and made pasta sauce.  That was it.  It was,
  however, about 33 degrees outside, and hotter inside (Damn stove and oven.), and
  I was a little bored and lonely the whole time, so it wasn't the most pleasant experience.
  \  Eventually, Mike came home and started raving about the delicious pasta sauce,
  which significantly improved my mood.  I ended up putting aside some small Ziploc
  containers of sauce for Tim and Mike.  \n\nThis sauce isn't quite the same as my
  last one.  I didn't have any carrots or celery in there, I used a pound of ground
  beef and the filling from 5 hot italian sausages, and instead of emptying a can
  of tomato sauce in there, I just used more tomatoes and more tomato paste.  This
  time, I had fresh oregano, and near the end of the recipe I cut up about half a
  bag of spinach into fine little bits and tossed it in (I'll fool myself to eat healthy,
  yet!) I don't think it turned out quite as delicious as the last one, but it still
  smells pretty good.  I tossed most of the sauce away in ziploc containers. It looks
  like I'm going to have quite a few spaghetti meals out of this one. \n\nOf course,
  the sauce took, like, 6 hours to make, so I had a whole $5 Little Caesars Hot n'
  Ready Pepperoni Pizza for dinner that night.  Oh boy, I can say that I'm probably
  not doing that again in the forseeable future.  Whugh, too much pizza.\n\nTomorrow,
  I hope to get the internet turned on at my house. I've been disconnected from reality
  for far too long. \n\nSo, it's almost 4:00.. I'm going to prepare some status reports,
  and then wander off to the \"Co-op Welcome Social\" at 4:00.  I had a long lunch
  with my co-workers (the entire Software Tools Support team, I think), so I'll probably
  be back to do a little more work before I go. \n\nI'll see you all next week!"
