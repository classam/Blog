  articles expound endlessly on a topic that is completely and utterly ridiculous.</em>\n\nGood
  afternoon, the internet. I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of eating like a <em>man</em>,
  man, have just made batches upon batches of <em>man food</em> to take to a barbeque.
  \n\nFirst of all, let's define \"Man Food\".  Merriam-Webster's online dictionary
  defines it as \"marked by diversity or variety\", but this is because Merriam-Webster
  does not contain a definition for \"Man Food\", instead suggesting words such as
  <u>manifold</u> &mdash; which, as we've established, means \"marked by diversity
  or variety\".\n\nNo, Man Food is the sort of food that a man can eat, or take to
  a barbeque.  It's quick to prepare and loaded with fat.  It feels perfectly appropriate
  to eat man food in boxers on a leather couch. But not briefs. That would be taking
  things too far. Man Food fits into one bowl, and can be comfortably eaten while
  \"watching the game\" &mdash; or, if you are, like me, a total nerd, comfortably
  eaten while watching downloaded episodes of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czmQfUmDcMg&feature=related\">Frisky
  Dingo</a>.  Boosh. \n\nSo the first item of Man Food to discuss is Bacon n' Beans.
  Bafflingly easy to make and eat, and it scores an 8.4 on the Tom Jones Flatulence
  Scale. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,1712,131183-247194,00.html\">recipe
  I used</a> calls for two cans of Heinz Pork n' Beans, and an equivalent amount of
  Great Northern beans.  This is common in recipes for food rookies like me - 50%
  prepackaged, to provide a standard, easy-to-understand base, and 50% <em>real, adult</em>
  ingredients to give the illusion of culinary grandeur.\n\nThe important part is
  to sweat an onion with some sliced bacon chunks.  Heck, straight-up adding that
  to canned pork and beans is a solid step forward, beanswise.  Maple-smoked bacon
  works especially well for this, because, hey, we're playing with the <em>Brown Sugar
  Spectrum</em>, here.  (Remind me to write an \"On the Topic of the Brown Sugar Spectrum\",
  later. )  \n\nOnce the bacons and onions are ready, just mix 'em up with the beans.
  \ Now it's time for random flavor ingredients! Ka-kow!  Molasses, smokey barbeque
  sauce, onion powder, dry mustard powder, brown sugar, these are all friends, because
  they are all part of the Brown Sugar Spectrum. \n\nAt this point, all we have to
  do is pour into a casserole dish and bake for 350 degrees at 30 minutes.  The resulting
  dish is meaty, sweet, and satisfying, like <a href=\"http://images.starpulse.com/pictures/2007/10/23/previews/Dolph%20Lundgren-SGG-074779.jpg\">this
