  Basketball Alliance</a>, a basketball league that only allows white American-born
  players, will start in June.  The commissioner, Don Lewis, is reported as saying
  something along the lines of \"I'm not racist, but I'm tired of the way that those
  fucking niggers, spics, and towelheads play basketball. What if they pull out a
  gun and rape your daughter in the middle of the game? That would be terrible.\"
  \ His opinions as to cotton-fields are as-yet unvoiced. \n\n<h3>Number 9 - Fu-fu-fu-fu-flickr
  Face, Fu-fu-fu-fu-face</h3>\n<a href=\"http://code.flickr.com/blog/2010/01/21/people-in-photos-the-api-methods/\">Flickr's
  new faces API</a> allows you to see who's in a picture, and see pictures of a specific
  person. Very simple, too. \n\n<h3>Number 8 - Plastic Guitar Problems </h3>\nApparently,
  people are getting sick of having three thousand plastic music gubbins in their
  living rooms, and the <a href=\"http://performancetrap.org/2009/10/28/decline-of-guitar-hero-and-rock-band/\">Rhythm
  Music genre is not selling as well as it used to</a>.  To anybody who did not see
  this coming thousands of miles away, I award you a condescending pat to the head.
  \n\n<h3>Number 7 - Carbon Dioxide Pushes Your Breasts Up </h3>\nIn the world of
  wearable tech, a prototype <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/01/corset-reacts-to-carbon-dioxide-levels-in-the-air/\">corset
  gets tighter in response to air-quality</a>, paradoxically making it even harder
  to breathe. \n\n<h3>Number 6 - Freelance </h3>\nSo, I found <a href=\"http://freelanceswitch.com/tag/freelance-freedom/\">this
  comic about freelancing</a>.  Today. It's been going on for a while.  It's not hilarious,
  but it is ... recognizable, I guess? So just read the whole archive, have a few
  chuckles, and get on with your day. \n\n<h3>Number 5 - AP AP BAP BAP BA </h3>\nI
  always wonder how a comic called \"<a href=\"http://www.wastedtalent.ca/index.php?view=442&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+WastedTalentRss+%28Wasted+Talent+RSS+Feeds%29&utm_content=Google+Reader\">Wasted
  Talent</a>\" is about a talented and consistently improving cartoonist who is also
  a field engineer and married to a software developer, and they've purchased an apartment
  in the downtown core?  I mean, that seems like a pretty efficient use of talent.
  \n\n<h3>Number 4 - Robot Sex Slave Blues </h3>\nOkay, so, I'm not going to lie,
  I was just pulled in by <a href=\"http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/01/20/Saturn-s-Children\">the
  name</a> of this article by Tim Bray. Seriously, isn't that a pretty good pull?
  With a title like that, you'll read <em>anything that he wants to write</em>. You
  have no choice.  Apparently it's a book review? I might have to buy this book now.
  \n\n<h3> Number 3 - Monetizing Print</h3>\nOkay, so, yesterday, I cut an article
  from the Top 10, one where the<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/01/new-york-times-plans-to-charge-for-articles/\">
  New York Times was going to put up a \"paywall\"</a> to try to make a little bit
  of money off of the internet - because 'new distribution models' (i.e. free everything)
  are cutting traditional newspapers' KNEES off. It didn't make the cut, but it's
  relevant to today's link - the author of Saturn's Children (the book about which
  the above article 'Robot Sex Slave Blues' was written) wrote a long article about
  how <a href=\"http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/01/the-monetization-paradox-or-wh.html\">he
  don't make no monies from the intarwob</a>. \n\nWhich is interesting, but people
  have been writing the same article for years now.  Now that everything on the internet
  is free, how the heck are we going to make money off of it?\n\n<h3> Number 2 - Web
  Security </h3> \nOkay, okay, by now, any web professional knows everything there
  is to know about Web Security. It doesn't hurt to read it <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/14/web-security-primer-are-you-part-of-the-problem/\">one
  more time</a>, just to keep things straight in your head.  It was even recommended
  by Bruce Schneier!\n\n<h3> Number 1 - CRAP </h3>\nMaking fun of food advertising?
  <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2010/01/21/ridiculous-gut-busti.html\">I love
  it</a>. \n\n"
