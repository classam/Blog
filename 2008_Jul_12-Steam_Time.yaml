content: ! "I love Valve's Steam.\n\nSteam is Valve's digital-distribution center-
  you pay by credit card and get unlimited access to downloads of a certain set of
  games.  Steam downloads the games, keeps 'em updated in the background, and if I
  swap computers, I can either move all of my game files over from the old computer
  or download them again.  I hate having huge collections of CD's, so that's good.
  \  The only potential problem is that if Valve happens to go under, I've lost maybe
  $500 worth of awesome video game- clearly problematic, I know- but I really enjoy
  the convenience of Steam.\n\nThere are a number of features that Steam lacks- you
  can't browse the web from within the Steam browser, although it's clearly HTTP-based
  (so why not?). You can't throttle or cap your downloads (So when it goes, it goes
  at full speed and if you don't have QoS on your router, your whole home network
  is going to be sluggish.)  The store makes you go through the exact-same slow-and-boring
  purchase process for every game you buy- even if you buy ten at a time. \n\nThe
  features- News, Friends, Servers, Settings... well, Friends works okay, but all
  of the rest of 'em aren't exactly great.\n\nOkay, so it's not exactly the best client
  out there- but Valve has the best PC games- they have the market clout, and my friends
  are on Steam, so I'm locked in that way, too.  It would be in other companies' best
  interest to hop on Steam as well- but it seems that, instead, they're all trying
  to release their own digital distribution clients.\n\nThe silliest one so far is
  Stardock's \"Impulse\", on account of they have maybe 2 games on there (Sins of
  a Solar Empire and Galactic Civilizations).  \n\nIn order to try to beef up their
  selection a bit, they've got some Corel products and some shitty desktop software
  rounding out the mix.  Okay- we'd all love to have a reasonable Windows package-manager-
  a Steam for applications, an apt-get for Windows- but that's such a huge undertaking
  that you can't just tack one on to an existing digital distribution system and hope
  for the best.  \n\nThe only company at this point that could hope to compete with
  Valve's rolling clout is EA, and I'm sure that they're trying their very best.  Having
  the most popular digital distribution system is a pure gem- right now, Valve is
  making all of the markup on games from about 15 different publishers sold online.
  That's pretty damn schwag. \n\nHere's the thing, though- all of this competition
  between digital distribution systems, tall and small, is a pain in the ass.  Oh,
  sure, from the company's standpoint, they want to be the storefront that people
  buy from, and sure, competition is good- but I don't want to run a lot of these
  things on my computer, have a lot of different usernames and profiles and such.
  I just want the one.  Large companies are sure to try to compete with Valve- there's
  no doubt about it- but small companies- you guys should just be trying to get your
  games on as many content distribution networks as possible. "
