  So, the guy who produces the kinda-boring syndicated newspaper comic Sally Forth
  also produces a webcomic called "<a href="http://www.drinkatwork.com/mediumlargewk110.html">Medium
  Large</a>" which is much more hilarious, violent, evil, etc...


  Aside from the boring running jokes, "Victorian Era Superhero" and "Teenage Girl
  President", it''s fantastically hilarious.


  I highly recommend you read it.'
