  found occasions where you're going to need to work for 32 hours at a stretch.  The
  first thing you do is go straight for the cans of Red Bull - or Monster, or Bawls,
  or RockStar, or EnergyBuzz, or what-have-you. \n\nBut if you're going to stay up
  late, this is not the right strategy.  The sudden, massive rush of caffeine in your
  system will keep you up a few hours, but you'll be jittery, you'll have to pee every
  couple of hours, and it'll wear off quickly. \n\nThus, we have Curtis's Amazing
  Stay Up Way Past Your Bedtime Strategy, field-tested with many a far-too-late-night.
  \n\n<h3> Lay off the Caffeine </h3>\nSeriously, the first tip is to stay away from
  any drink that offers 9000 milligrams of Taurine and tastes like metallic chalk
  with a hint of sugar.  Instead, try tea. \n\n<em>Tea? That's not a manly gamer drink!
  </em>\n\n'Sho is! A cup of tea has about half as much caffeine as a cup of coffee,
  but it also contains antioxidant polyphenols which extend the efficacy of said caffeine.

  \n\nWhat that means is that a cup of tea has got you covered for at least 5 hours
  of action, without the jitters, constant peeing, and inevitable crash. \n\n<h3>
  Light Exercise </h3>\nCoding can be a narrow, cramping, uncomfortable process.  Sitting
  at a table for many hours at a stretch isn't necessarily ergonomically sound in
  the first place- but pile on a 16-hour-day on top of that and you're going to hurt
  yourself.  On top of that, it's impossible to just code for that much time- your
  brain needs frequent rests to process new information, plan ahead, and just not
  code.\n\nSo- at LEAST every 20-30 minutes- step away from your computer and jog
  about a bit, or do some pushups, or stretch and move around a bit.  Not only does
  it keep you from seriously injuring yourself with poor ergonomics, it gets your
  blood flowing and gives you some energy back.  And that's energy you're going to
  need for late-night coding.\n\n<h3> Sleep </h3>\n\nIf you're going to work for a
  very long stretch, you're going to need to fit some sleep in there, whether you
  like it or not.  I find that 4-5 hours will do it for you pretty well. \n\nShort
  catnaps can be effective for some, but I have the problem of sleep inertia- once
  I get started sleeping, it's going to be absolutely horrifying to get back up again.\n\nIf
  you follow my advice, well... try to organize things so that you don't have to follow
  my advice. It's really quite unpleasant. Good luck!"
