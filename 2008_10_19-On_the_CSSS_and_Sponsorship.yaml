  Sponsorship</a>. These are my thoughts.


  Sponsorship is a tricky question.


  As a VPA, I found that the trouble wasn''t money, so much- it was organization.
  It takes a lot of time and effort to plan an event, get people to come to the event,
  advertise the event, get people to bring equipment to the event, keeping people
  at the event from showing up drunk and blowing chunks in garbage cans, then embarassing
  themselves in front of professors, staying at the event long enough to clean everything
  up, drowsily eating waffles at IHOP after the event...


  Keep in mind that one of the biggest problems facing the society isn''t usually
  lack of money- it''s usually some form of Executive Neglect. Keeping everybody interested
  and involved is the biggest problem.


  Now, there are a lot of ways the CSSS could be adjusted to increase the amount of
  money we bring in- and there are a lot of potential uses for this money.


  We could sell advertising space in the Common Room to sponsors. We could accept
  and manage sponsorship deals. We could register as a Non-Profit Organization and
  accept donations. We could produce and sell swag. We could farm human bodies for
  electricity while keeping them suspended in an elaborate simulation of life. We
  could *blah blah blah blah*.


  Thing is, all of these things require close oversight, careful planning, and a lot
  of work. If at any point, one neglectful executive set comes along, the whole thing
  could fall apart like a house of cards. Checkmate.


  Honestly, we have serious trouble keeping the few fiscal things that we do regularly
  manage afloat. Pop, pizza, and photocopies, mainly- with Frosh-Week and the FAS
  Formal as rare and *difficult* occurrences. Do we really want to have to deal with
  more of that? Is the pop-machine full right now? Are we really happy with the way
  the copy-machine is turning out? Be honest.


  We could bring in more money, but with more money comes more administration, more
  accountability, stiffer requirements. Events become harder to plan, not easier.


  The only way that the SFSS can stay afloat under it''s own stifling weight is because
  it''s massive bureaucracy is supported by a few layers of administrators that we
  rarely see. Being a part of the SFSS isn''t any fun- it''s deadly serious. Millions
  of dollars are at stake. I don''t think anybody or their mother would want to be
  Shawn Hunsdale right now. The SFSS has precious little ''community''- it''s more
  an organization than anything.


  The reason the CSSS is what it is.. is because it''s small.


  It''s easy to be a member, it''s fun, it''s casual, and even so, we manage to accomplish
  great things.


  If the CSSS executive can sit in the common room and drum up games of 1000-blank-white-cards,
  or Chess, or Go, or the Chairman''s Game.. the CSSS is successful.


  The only reason we run the pizza, the pop, and the photocopier is because people
  like to eat cheap pizza, drink cheap pop, and make cheap photocopies. Now that there
  are other places to eat cheap pizza and make cheap photocopies, we could (and *should*)
  just bow out of those arenas and replace all of that painful administrative effort
  working on other CSSS services- the much neglected "Old Test Repository", which
  could seriously use some love and digitization. The famed "Menu Project". Games
  nights, Movie nights, and LAN parties- which need not cost a penny. Tutorials on
  open-source technologies. Our web-presence.


  We could run the entire organization without money at all, and still be a valuable
  and useful student service- arguably a *more* valuable and useful student service
  because we''re not exhausting our time and effort painfully administering finances.


  The CSSS is successful, not because of money, but because of the time and effort
  and love of the members involved. Dealing with money- even FREE MONEY- drains our
  time and effort and love- and in my opinion hurts the society more than it helps.
