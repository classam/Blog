  />\n\nI'm going to tell a tale- a tale of a lost, forlorn user, and the user interface
  that betrayed him. This is a true story- only the names have been changed to protect
  the innocent.\n\n\tThis is the story of Jeremy.\n\n\tJeremy, of course, was a computer
  professional. His computer skills were unmatched. They say that the Inuit have twelve
  words for snow- well, Jeremy had seventeen words for software failure. Jeremy didn't
  have to code- he could just debug a blank page until software appeared.\n\n\tNow
  Jeremy wanted to burn a DVD, and the only computers available were Macs.\n\n\t“No
  problem,” thought Jeremy, “I'm a professional. This should be a snap. Macs are based
  on Unix, right, and I know Linux- I should be fine!”\n\n\tSo he sat down in front
  of an unused eMac in the lab. The unused eMacs were, to save power, turned off.
  \n\n\tHow does somebody turn on an eMac?\n\n\tThis was the question that baffled
  Jeremy, as he searched across the flat, featureless, buttonless eMac. Is that a
  button? No, it's a speaker. This is clearly the CD drive. The keyboard doesn't have
  any 'on' buttons. How does somebody turn on an eMac?\n\n\tThis is when Jeremy started
  to become frustrated. He felt along the sides of the computer- found a few USB ports
  and a Firewire port, but nothing more than that. He was able to see behind other
  eMacs- no buttons on the back. \n\n\tHe tried clicking the mouse, pressing random
  buttons on the keyboard, pressing against every concievable surface of the eMac.
  \ He went over to the Windows computer and looked for help on the internet. Could
  anybody design a computer without an 'on' button?\n\n\tFinally, poor Jeremy grew
  so frustrated that he pulled the eMac right forward on the table to get a better
  look at the back. There it was- the holy grail of technology! An 'on' button! Praise!\n\n\tThe
  button was, of course, the same colour as the rest of the computer, little bigger
  than the size of Jeremy's thumb, and flush with the system. It was located in the
  back-right corner of the box, in a position where it's all-but-impossible to see
  from the front. If it were any harder to find, it would be located in a different
  country under the alias “Senor Buttuono”.\n\n\tJeremy, of course, was used to the
  happy, magical world of personal computer towers- big, bold backlit power buttons
  on the front of the box, where even a nosey toddler could find and press them without
  any sort of issue.\n\n\tCranky and disillusioned with the Macintosh experience,
  Jeremy continued on his sojourn to burn a DVD.  But wait- before we go...\n\n\tHow
  does someone open the CD tray on an eMac?"
