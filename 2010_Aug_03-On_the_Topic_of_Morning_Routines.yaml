  articles expound endlessly on a topic that is completely and utterly ridiculous.</em>\n\nGood
  afternoon, the internet. I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of waking up, have
  just gone through my morning routine for the 8,942nd consecutive time.\n\nIt starts
  with my CD-powered alarm clock, which has contained the same mix-CD since I bought
  it.   In Grade 11.  Why mess with a good thing? I can listen to the music playing
  and know exactly how long it's been since the alarm has gone off, without having
  to open my eyes or think excessively hard &mdash; both tasks that can be troublesome
  in the morning.\n\nBy the time it gets to Daft Punk, I'm usually at least mostly
  awake and alert. In University, it usually made it all of the way to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmwlzwGMMwc\">Tom
  Lehrer's Element Song</a>, which was just one of the <a href=\"http://www.translink.ca/\">many
  reasons</a> that I was pretty consistently late for class. \"These are the only
  ones of which the news has come to Haaaarvard... and there may be many others but
  they haven't been discaaaaavered\" became the morning death knell for any pretense
  of arriving in class on time. \n\nAfter I get out of bed, it's time for the shower
  (optional), and shave (optional), at which point I am usually quite late.  There's
  time to briefly stare, wistfully, at the Cheerios that sit on top of the refrigerator.
  \ They're mocking me. \"You never have time to eat us. Maybe if you give up hygiene.
  You, too, can taste of the morning oaty goodness.\"  I hate those smug Cheerios.
  They think they're so much better than me.\n\nAt this point, I usually do 1000 pushups,
  take a 30 kilometer ride on my bicycle, and then drive to work, practicing my over-the-top
  lies in the car along the way.\n\nSince I've started work, I've started loading
  leftovers into these tiny, modular lunch-sized containerbowls.  Two or three containerbowls
  makes a pretty good &mdash; and pretty varied &mdash; lunch.  The only trouble is
  that I'm not sure if I want to be the sort of dude who has his fridge filled with
  hundreds of nigh-identical meal-units.  At that point, it might be time to just
  give up and buy a pocket protector and some enormous plastic glasses. \n\nThis morning,
  I took cream and sugar to work with me.  It felt strange, walking through the park
  to work, holding a carton of cream.  \"What are you doing?\", I imagined the park
  patrons saying.\n\n\"I'm walking my cream.\" "
