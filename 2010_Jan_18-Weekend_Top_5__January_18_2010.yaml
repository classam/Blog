  weekend.\n\n<h3> Number 5 - Tetris Blanket </h3>\nBoingBoing brings us a blanket
  that is <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2010/01/17/homemade-tetris-blan.html\">incredibly
  frustrating to look at</a>. \n\n<h3> Number 4 - SexSlurp Color Search </h3>\nI'm
  pretty sure this <em>extremely NSFW</em> tool was born in the trenches of Reddit
  &mdash; long ago when a redditor connected his vast, vast porn collection to a picture
  of a rainbow, and selecting a color of the rainbow would produce a color of ...
  <a href=\"http://sexslurp.com/colour\">pornography</a>.\n\n<h3> Number 3 - No, I
  Don't Think You Understand </h3>\nThere are entirely valid reasons not to have liked

  blogger finds a cat in a stadium. <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/01/16/mile-high-caturday/\">And
  kittens</a>! \n\n<h3> Number 1 - Collective Knowledge </h3>\nChris Dixon explores
  the popularity of <a href=\"http://cdixon.org/2010/01/17/collective-knowledge-systems/\">Collective
  Knowledge Systems</a>. This is something I'm interested in. So there. \n\n"
