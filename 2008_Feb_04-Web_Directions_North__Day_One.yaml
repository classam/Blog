content: ! "So, I attended Web Directions North last week. \n\nWeb Directions North
  is a Vancouver conference for web developers and designers.  As a kind of quick
  summary, it was 12 lectures from a variety of speakers on topics relevant to the
  web.\n\nThanks to my <acronym title=\"CMPT 384\">Symbolic Computing</acronym> homework
  and the astronomical distance between me and the Hyatt Hotel in Vancouver- right
  next to Burrard Skytrain station, if you're wondering- I had about 5 hours of sleep.
  \ 5 hours of sleep might be appropriate for a first-year Comp Sci student, but I'm
  starting to need at least 8 a day to feel like a productive member of society.\n\nI
  met up with <a title=\"Allen Pike\" href=\"http://www.antipode.ca/\">Allen</a> and
  <a title=\"Andrew Kumar\" href=\"http://andrewkumar.com/\">Kumar</a> just after
  the first keynote- Kumar's distinctive yellow hat was like a beacon, and as soon
  as I saw it I knew he was there.  It's actually a really good idea- Kumar has his
  own brand already. \n\n<img src=\"http://north08.webdirections.org/wp-content/themes/wdn08/i/photos/speaker-jz.jpg\"
  alt=\"Jeffrey Zeldman\" />The keynote speaker was <a href=\"http://www.zeldman.com/\">Jeffrey
  Zeldman</a>, publisher of \"<a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/\">A List Apart</a>\"
  and web-standards advocate, describing his history with Web Standards.  While it
  was interesting to learn a little bit more of the history behind web standards,
  there wasn't anything really new or interesting, and the talk was a little slow.\n\nAfter
  the keynote, we had breakfast.  Tea and baked goods are always a good way to start
  the day, although I found the tea lacked the necessary caffeine to pull me out of
  my yawning, tired funk. \n\n<img src=\"http://north08.webdirections.org/wp-content/themes/wdn08/i/photos/speaker-jw.jpg\"
  alt=\"Josh Williams\" />The first presentation of the day was Josh Williams' \"Bedroom
  To Boardroom\".  Josh Williams discussed how his company, <a href=\"http://www.firewheeldesign.com/\">Firewheel
  Design</a>, moved from small-scale consulting to development of their own products.
  \ Josh Williams had some good advice- my favourite bit being this: When consulting,
  it's more profitable (and fun) to hyperspecialize in a niche than it is to be a
  little bit good at everything.  \n\nApparently, also, there is a lot of work out
  there for icon designers, if we happened to be interested.\n\nI don't actually work
  with icons that often for sites- but it's definitely something I should <a href=\"http://www.iconbuffet.com/\">look
  at</a>. \n\nMore tomorrow!"
