  letter in Photoshop</a>, a curt hand-written note, and rustling about the house
  at 4 in the morning, I managed to convince my parents that I left early this morning
  to engage in a 1-month Technical Officer Training program at a Canadian Forces base
  in Hope. \n\nMy dad was so convinced that he was telling people at work that I had
  left for a month in Hope.  Some people called him on it - It must be an April Fools
  joke!  But no, he said- he has this Canadian Forces letter. \n\nApparently, they
  all had a good laugh at his expense when I phoned him at work and let him know.
