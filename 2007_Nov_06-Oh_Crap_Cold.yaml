  was cold in the morning, and a strong wind blew nasty frosty chunks right in to
  the ol' face.\n\nThen, at about lunch time, there was a sudden 'snowstorm'- and
  I mean something that would qualify as a snowstorm in Vancouver, but is barely a
  sprinkling for Ontarians.  It melted as soon as it hit the ground. \n\nOn the way
  home? More cold.\n\nI miss you, Vancouver! "
