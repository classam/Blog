content: ! "I have prepared a soup that I shall name \"Curaga\", because it contains
  every folk remedy I can think of- hopefully to see me free of this cold by tomorrow
  afternoon.\n\nChicken broth, simmered with a head of garlic, a baggie of barbequed
  chicken from the supermarket, a spoonful of powdered ginger, a very, very spicy
  dried pepper, chili sesame oil, bean sprouts, soy sauce, green onions, celery, and
  every other spare vegetable found in the fridge.\n\nIt's good, but really spicy.
  I underestimated that tiny, bright orange, dried chile pepper. For once, though,
  I actually WANT to clear out my sinuses. Also, a bulb of garlic that's been simmered
  in chicken broth for about 30 minutes is soft and really, really delicious. \n\nOf
  course, I'm accompanying this with mankind's *second* oldest cold remedy, NyQuil. "
