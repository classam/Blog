  Cable: Quite Possibly A Pile Of Hot Dogs\" />\n\nSo, yesterday, my home internet
  was disconnected for a day by Rogers.  The reason?  Apparently, one of our computers
  has an IRC bot virus. \n\nNow, I can't help but think that perhaps our account was
  flagged thanks to the fact that both me and Tim are nar' constantly connected to
  IRC in the background- and me with Ubuntu, no less!\n\nNow, while I understand that
  for the average-joe user, the likelihood that they'll actually be using IRC is much,
  much lower than the likelihood that they have contracted some form of IRC-related
  virus. By giving users with suspicious levels of IRC activity an internet suspension
  and getting them to clean up their computers (or pay someone else to), Rogers is
  putting the responsibility for security in the hands of the internet users, which
  isn't necessarily a bad idea.  If they do raise a false positive, chances are they've
  flagged a nerd- and we're more trouble than we're worth anyways, always trying to
  use our paltry internet services to run servers and open SSH ports, and all sorts
  of other stuff that they don't want to have to deal with.\n\nWhen it comes down
  to it, security is far more important for average users than, say, the ability to
  do wild and wacky things with their internet.  Open up HTTP, POP, and SMTP and most
  internet users have all the functionality they could ever hope for. (This, coincidentally,
  was one of the reasons AOL's business model was a good idea: \"People do not want
  to devote time towards learning how to use the internet\" was as true then as it
  is now)\n\nOur household has a software developer, software tester, graphic designer
  and game-freak math student.  We've got maybe 30 years of internet experience between
  us.  We have 4 computers, a fileserver, and 3 internet-connected consoles in our
  house, and we depend on the internet for phone service, entertainment, information,
  the works.  \n\nRogers can promise these great super-fast high-end personal plans,
  they're always going to pair them up with idiot-friendly nerd-punishing policies.
  \ So.. how much do I have to pay to be treated like an adult? Maybe the \"Small
  Business\" Internet service? It's maybe $20 more, per month, for what amounts to
  exactly the same service- but would that extra $20 buy us, say, a certain level
  of respect for the sanctity of our holy connection? The ability to do weird and
  esoteric shit with our internet without losing internet service?  As a \"Small Business\",
  is it more reasonable for us to raise holy hell if our internet goes down for *any*
  reason? \n\nThe next \"infraction\" will buy us a week's suspension.  I'd drop the
  provider immediately and move to a more nerd-friendly enterprise if such a thing
  were to happen to me.. but our internet is managed by our landlord, and I'm only
  going to be in Waterloo for another 2 months. Humbug. "
