content: ! "First Impressions: \"Whee heeee!\"\n\nFor every Nintendo system released
  after the Nintendo Entertainment System, there's been an accompanying Mario Kart
  game. Super Nintendo had Mario Kart- a spectacular racer at the time, but technically
  very difficult. The Nintendo 64 had Mario Kart 64, a much easier game that put the
  emphasis more firmly on smacking the bejeesus out of your opponents with items,
  which managed to make the game even more fun than before.  Mario Kart 64 also introduced
  the power-slide-heavy game mechanics which have become a cornerstone of the series
  since. \n\nThe Game Boy Advance had a pretty spot-on recreation of the original
  Mario Kart.\n\nWith the GameCube came Mario Kart Double Dash, a game that concentrated
  so firmly on beating the ever-loving snot out of your opponents that you could actually
  get an entire person dedicated to that task on one controller.  The GameCube also
  introduced a couple of series standbys that have become synonymous with the series,
  popular or not. Blue sparks and the dreaded blue shell, to name a few.  \n\nMario
  Kart DS ended up being a fantastic balance between all of the elements we had seen
  so far- there was just the right amount of racing, just the right amount of 'beating
  other people up', the multiplayer was tight and attractive, and everything was beautiful
  and perfect- at least as far as I'm concerned.\n\nSo, what do we get from Mario
  Kart Wii?  Well, first of all, it's the closest to Mario Kart DS in terms of gameplay-
  a balanced racing-and-fighting experience.  It's the most customizable of all of
  the series so far- racers can tweak a number of different variables in the races,
  from item type to the variant of karts that opponents will use.\n\nMario Kart Wii
  introduces the Wii Wheel.  Don't worry, though- you can still play with the good
  ol' fashioned Gamecube controller if you're looking for the traditional Mario Kart
  experience. Or the Classic controller. Or the Wiimote and Nunchuk.  The controller
  feels tighter and delivers a more comfortable racing experience for those of us
  who are veterans to the series- but I've been forcing myself to use the Wheel, and
  it's turning out to be a seriously satisfying experience. Okay, it's not nearly
  as 'tight' as using the controller, but it's just plain ol' more fun.  I only have
  the two wheels, so far.\n\nI introduced my parents to the series- they're not much
  further than Wii Sports when it comes to playing video games, but with the Wii Wheel
  on Time Trial mode they were able to pick up and enjoy racing almost immediately.

  alt=\"Mario Kart Wii\" />\n\nIn Mario Kart Wii, you're racing against 12 opponents
  instead of 8.  This can make it a lot tougher to recover from a bad position- when
  you're in 8th place, you're <strong>not</strong> getting the super-powered items
  that will slingshot you back to the front- the people getting those items are right
  behind you. When you're in 12th place, there's almost nothing that's going to shoot
  you to first- even with a bullet or a well-placed star, you'll be lucky to get into
  7th place, where you'll be struggling the old fashioned way to overtake the other
  racers.\n\nAs an unfortunate aside, you can't play the Grand Prix in two-player
  mode, which was one of my favourite features from Double Dash- I don't want to beat
  Mario Kart on my own, I want to beat it with Kristen. (Also, I want to beat Kristen,
  but that's beside the point.)\n\nThe graphics are unspectacular.  It's just how
  the Wii rolls. \n\nSome of the game mechanics from Double Dash and the DS are toned
  down a bit.  There will be no 'snaking' in Mario Kart for the Wii- slides take a
  fixed amount of time, and you're probably going to have to go around a corner to
  have enough time for the slides to be a good idea. In addition to the Karts are
  Motorcycles, an alternative to the Kart that instead of blue-sparks-slide-boosts
  can pop a wheelie for a quick boost.  The wheelies are easier to pull off than the
  slides, but don't confer as much of a bonus. \n\nThe game also introduces Automatic
  and Manual play- in Automatic, you don't need to worry about sliding around corners-
  the game will perform a slide automatically if you turn deeply enough. You lose
  any ability to boost yourself, however.  I've been playing a lot of Automatic- while
  it's not quite as difficult, it just feels more natural with the Wii Wheel.\n\nAll
  in all, the game is a lot of fun- and as of right now, there are ten thousand reviews
  of it on the internet, so you don't need to hear my thoughts.  Want to give it a
  try? I'm probably bringing it to Phil's barbeque."
