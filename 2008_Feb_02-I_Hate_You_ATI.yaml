content: ! "I just recently purchased a new computer.  Happiness ensued- quad of the
  cores, 3Gbs of the memories, and a big hard drive.  \n\nOf course, even given it's
  many specs, it was a Best-Buy Special, so the computer inside lacks a decent motherboard
  or reasonable power-supply- a mere 300W.\n\nThe on-board Intel graphics irked me
  most of all- with all of that computing power, you might as well have at least two
  monitors.  Okay, so I bought a cheapy <a href=\"http://ati.amd.com/products/radeonhd2400/radeonhd2400pro/index.html\">ATI
  Radeon HD 4200 Pro</a>, a low-end 256mb graphics card, to support an additional
  monitor.  Given the powerful core-ful computer, I figure even a low-end graphics
  card should be able to support some mild Team Fortress 2, as well.  \n\nSo, I get
  home, open the motherboard, cram that PCI-Express card in there with much gusto,
  and power on. \n\nNothing.\n\nThe computer's clearly abuzz with activity, but none
  of the monitors are working at all. Okay, that sucks.\n\nI remove the graphics card
  and it's connected monitor, and just try it with a single monitor. Everything's
  fine, Vista takes 11,000 years to start, the old same-ol'-same-ol'. \n\nSomething's
  wrong with the graphics card.  I try the card again, figuring maybe it wasn't fitted
  snugly enough. Nope, fail.\n\nWhen I turned the computer on with the two monitors
  the first time, though, it did turn on, turn off immediately, and then turn on again
  and stay on. Maybe the problem's a power thing? \n\nIt's time to check the manual.
  \ I pull the CD out of the drive, start reading the manual, and.. hey, this manual
  is for an AGP graphics card! And a totally different model of graphics card that
  apparently requires at least a 750W power supply.\n\nI check the box. Yep, it says
  '300W or better' in the power-supply requirements. \n\nSo, ATI clearly failed to
  include a pertinent manual.  Let's check their website.\n\nThe support system on
  the website is terrible.  It's organized poorly, the information I want is all over
  the place, and nothing seems to solve my problem.\n\nOh, here's something- if I
  can't get an image through POST, I need to check if I have an integrated graphics
  card (yeop) and if I do, disable it in the BIOS.\n\nWhat's POST? Shouldn't there
  be an explanation of that around here somewhere?  I'll just check Google. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-on_self-test\">Power-on-self-test</a>-
  oh, yeah, that's the important first bit where the BIOS starts everything up and
  displays images and whatnot.  The other explanation is that (surprise) I may not
  have enough power. \n\nBut.. wait- if my graphics card isn't working, and I disable
  my built-in card.. and it doesn't work.. then I have no card at all! And no way
  to fix it, without a monitor!\n\nOkay, I need further support.  It's time to contact
  Tech Support.  Finding out how to contact Tech Support is the first step- it's a
  horrifying ordeal on AMD's webpage.  They don't have an 800 number, just a bunch
  of miscellaneous long-distance numbers that I can call if I want to spend $15 to
  wait on hold. \n\nOh, here's an online ticket form. Great!\n\nFirst, though, I need
  to sign up.  Name, e-mail address, location, blood type, favourite colour, etcetera
  etcetera. I hate signing up just to get support.\n\nNow I've reached stage 2- actually
  submitting a ticket.  The system informs me that filling in the fields adequately
  will help my ticket be dealt with, so I fill in the model number, information about
  my computer, my Oscar picks for 2008, just about everything that I can tell them.
  \ Then, a quick description of my problem.\n\nI send it off, secure in the thought
  that my problem might be solved. Eventually.\n\nI check my e-mail.. nothing yet.
  I know it's going to take a while, but maybe they have an automated reciept or something?\n\nNow
  it's 2 hours later and I get an \"automated response\" with such useful information
  as where to find manuals, where to go on the site to learn about cool features in
  ATI's newest product, and a place to learn about new features in ATI's software.
  \ \n\nTo add insult to injury, the instructions about how to get to the manual -
  the one bit of information I could have used- didn't even come with a link, instead
  with the vague instructions \"If you are looking for a manual please click on your
  product and select “Manuals User Guides & How-To’s”.\"\n\nNow, being that I can't
  actually click on my product (it's external to the computer) I guess they meant
  my product's homepage? I don't know, they didn't provide a link to anything.\n\nOn
  the incredibly slim chance that this amazingly useful support would *fail* to solve
  my problem, I'm now instructed to log-in *again* and update my ticket- once again
  without a useful link to get me to where I'm going. \n\nNow, I'm frustrated, both
  by the fact that my card doesn't work and by the momentously poor customer service
  I've been getting from ATI, with a little bit of peripheral frustration at Acer
  for building a moderately high-end computer with such a terrible motherboard and
  power supply.\n\nLong story short: I hate all human beings. "
