  that *I* wrote, doing something useful.  I check it daily, even!\n\nThis may not
  be a milestone in the imagination of most of my more software-development-experienced
  friends, but for me it's a Big Thing.\n\nOkay, enough with the self-congratulations.
  \ I built <a title=\"PieRC SFUCSSS\" href=\"http://www.infinitebukkake.com\">PieRC</a>,
  a combination of IRC-Bot and webpage.  It silently logs everything that happens
  on the #sfucsss IRC channel on freenode.net, and posts it online, in a searchable,
  browsable format.\n\nThe IRC-Bot is Python-powered, and it runs on an ancient laptop
  which sits, everpresent, at my feet.  The whole system seriously needs an upgrade
  -- I'm thinking to Ubuntu Server, because its desktop performance is poor at best,
  but it's good enough to run a Python script.  I just need to give it the ol' foot
  every now and then because it's gone offline for one reason or another. \n\nI know,
  I know, IRC logs can also be stored by your computer, and you can grep through them-
  but PieRC can be -shared-, it's easy to use, and everybody's working from the same
  logs.  Also? You can see what happens in channel when you're not around.  It tentatively
  supports multiple channels, although currently the only channel I have it pointed
  at is #sfucsss. \n\nThings we say in channel are already starting to pop up on Google,
  which is going to be pretty incriminating if people start to associate things I
  say with ... me.\n\nMy next planned feature might be Github integration, because
  that would be neato-pants.  The source-code itself will be made available on Github
  in the near future- It's not quite ready to be released as a 'product' yet. "
