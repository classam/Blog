content: ! 'Samuel L. Jackson just called me.

  He somehow knew my name.

  He called to tell me about Snakes On A Plane. And that I should see it. On August
  the 18th.

  And I shall.


  Prerecorded telephone advertising- is this new?

  Regardless, this specific recording was pretty awesome. If it wasn''t Snakes On
  A Plane, though- if it was some shit like The Devil Wears Prada... well, I''d be
  mighty pissed.'
