  />\n\nSo, I spent most of my workday yesterday reading about the project that I'll
  be working on. Today, I'm working on setting myself up, and I'll be able to actually
  play with code soon. Hurrah!\n\nI'm not going to talk too much about the project
  that I'm working on- You probably don't care too much, and while what I'm doing
  isn't mission critical or sensitive, an NDA is an NDA, so I'm just going to give
  you the stuff that would go on a resume. I'm a Software Developer with the Software
  Tools Support Team, and I'm working with Apache, PHP, Ms SQL Server, and Perforce.
  \  (P.S. : Perforce's \"View\" system is pretty cool, but P4V and P4Win have nothing
  on the snazzy elegance of TortoiseSVN)\n\nSo, when I finished work, yesterday, I
  bought a 5-use bus pass for 8 bucks, and hopped on the Number 9 Bus to Conestoga
  Mall. It takes a while to get there, but they have all of the mall in the area,
  so .. yeah. To Zellers!\n\nI bought a big stainless steel stock pot for the sauce..
  It's pretty low quality- you can almost see through it, it's so thin. but I plan
  to do most of the frying in the nice new Teflon frying pan that I bought yesterday.
  \n\nI also picked up some cutting boards, a mug or two, a laundry basket, and enough
  tinned food to see me through a nuclear winter. Yay soup!\n\nI came home, planning
  to start the sauce, then remembered that the butcher would be closed by the time
  I got there. Maybe tomorrow, I guess. I ended up eating bacon and hashbrowns for
  dinner. I would have had eggs, too, but they sat too far back in the fridge and
  froze/cracked. It turns out that the very back part of our fridge doubles as a freezer.
  Also, our Meat Container Thing is loose.\n\nThen, I socked out on the couch and
  watched some more Scrubs. I'm pretty sure I'm going to finish the whole thing before
  I get enough internet to download a different show to watch. (Come on, Saturday!)\n\nWhile
  I may not have internet access, I have my BlackBerry. I followed a heated discussion
  on the topic of Frosh Survival Guides until well into the morning (stupid time zone).
  \n\nThis morning, I came to work with a can of Ravioli in hand (mmm... inexpensive).
  There was a short meeting/tutorial detailing some dev tools we're using or managing.
  When I came back, it was almost time for lunch.\n\nI've also been invited, with
  the rest of the Co-op students, for burgers n' beer at the McGinnis tonight.  I
  guess the sauce is going to have to wait another day!  It seems like a weekend thing
  anyways.\n\nMy BlackBerry is the coolest thing ever.  It looks like Tim ended up
  getting an even prettier model though.  I can't remember what it's number was, but
  it was a bit slicker than mine.  I have cool features, though! Maps! Notes! A calendar!
  E-mail! A web browser! More!"
