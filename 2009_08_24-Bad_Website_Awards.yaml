content: ! "So, according to a client of mine, a web-search for \"Vancouver Website
  Awards\" turns up <a href=\"http://www.pbsco.com/\">pbsco.com/</a>.  If you're feeling
  a little down about your website design abilities, this site, with design techniques
  straight out of 1996, will make you feel better. \n\nFrames? Animated GIFs? Guestbooks?
  They do it all, and they do it in tandem with \"Improvisual Web Hosting\", a company
  that will give you <strong>200 whole megabytes</strong> of space on their servers
  for only $9.99. Wotta deal! For a company who claims to be 'seeing the future of
  webhosting', they certainly seem to have a lot of trouble digging themselves out
  of the nineties. What if you want to run \"Scripts\" or host more than one website
  from the same server? <strong>Oh, guess you'll have to upgrade</strong>.\n\nI've
  actually seen some dedicated developers pull some pretty slick stuff out of tables-only
  no-css web design. I mean, I still think it's a terrible way to lay out a site,
  but it can be made to work. These sites don't even try. \n\nThe real kicker is that
  they seem to still be in business, producing bad websites for gullible clients.
  \ \n\nIt's a bit heartening to know that even if I let my web-design skills atrophy
  for 10 years, I'll still be able to sell them to a few misguided dinosaurs. "
