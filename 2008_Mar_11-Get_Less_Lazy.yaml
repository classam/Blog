  to see developers specifying that <em>This site must be viewed in FireFox</em>.
  \ \n\nOkay, it's not quite so bad as specifying that a site <em>must be viewed in
  Internet Explorer</em>, which is a really anger-generating move.  \n\nEven so, though,
  at a bare minimum, your site should be usable in Internet Explorer 7, Firefox, Opera,
  and Safari. If you're really masochistic, you can shoehorn IE6 support in, there,
  too. Modern standards-compliant browsers can take just about anything you throw
  at them, if you're using a flexible standards-compliant layout. Occasionally you
  have to add a couple of extra lines of code to accomodate IE7, but even then it's
  not too much trouble. \n\n<em>This site must be viewed in FireFox</em> means, to
  me, <em>too lazy to test in Internet Explorer, Safari, or Opera. </em>"
