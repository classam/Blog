  articles expound endlessly on a topic that is completely and utterly ridiculous.</em>\n\nI'm
  not the sort of person to set a lot of house rules upon moving in with somebody,
  but I have decided that if I ever have a house with tenants, the following rules
  will apply: \n\n<ul>\n<li> You may have pets.  You may not have any pets smaller
  or louder than a chihuahua. </li>\n<li> Posters featuring the movie \"Half Baked\"
  are not allowed.  </li>\n<li> The movie \"Half Baked\" is not allowed. </li>\n<li>
  You may drink as much or as little as you so choose, but PBR and Budweiser are not
  allowed on the premises, for being too ironic and not ironic enough respectively.
  </li> \n<li> Any and all Blanket Forts must pass a cursory check by an accredited
  home inspector. Alternatively, ask us about our ground-breaking bribery program.
  </li> \n<li> No Irish. </li>\n<li> You <em>can</em> dance, you can dance, everybody
  look at your hands. </li>\n<li> Use of the bathroom between 1:00 and 1:04 AM is
  strictly forbidden.  Note: this rule will not be strictly enforced, and has no real
  justification.  </li>\n<li> Each-and-every trip to the kitchen MUST end in a mandatory
  touching of the lucky Blaster.  Failure to touch the transformer may result in bad
  luck. </li> \n</ul>"
