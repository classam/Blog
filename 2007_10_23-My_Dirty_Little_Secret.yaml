  knowing what they mean.  I've heard them in similar sentences before, and the usage
  feels right, and I have an idea what those words mean.. but I'm not sure. \n\nThen,
  I'll look those words up in a dictionary, and find out that I was right.\n\nThen,
  I feel good and start using that word again and again and again. \n\nSo.. \"Ostensibly\".
  \"Ostensibly ostensibly ostensibly.\" \"Ostensibly\". \n\nThank you. "
