content: ! "So, just recently, Reddit found it rather hilarious that the Onion's joking
  shot at Gillette (<a href=\"http://www.theonion.com/content/node/33930\">Fuck Everything,
  We're Doing Five Blades</a>) turned out not to be quite as silly as once planned
  - in fact, the Gillette Fusion has 6 blades, 2 aloe strips, and a BATTERY.\n\nIn
  fact, most of us- at least, those of us who shave- are starting to feel like the
  commercial razor industry is starting to get a little bit excessive and silly for
  it's own pants.  It has to be pretty wasteful to toss away 6 blades, 2 aloe strips
  and a *battery* after a week of shaving.\n\nI have to admit- I tried the Fusion.
  Just before I left for Waterloo, my uncle hooked me up with a Fusion Razor and 9
  'heads'.  It's a pretty clean shave, and thanks to the ridiculous number of blades
  and my fairly lax shaving schedule, I managed to drag 8 razor-heads out for my entire
  4-month stay in Waterloo.\n\nNevertheless, I'm still curious about a more traditional,
  less-wasteful solution that's (hopefully) a bit more economical than buying a tonne
  of cartridges- especially as I'm finding the need for a good shave more and more
  prevalent.  A straight razor shave is not for me, though- it takes skill, and an
  incredibly sharp blade plus a sleepy morning is a recipe for a trip to the hospital.\n\nSo,
  I found this article on MSNBC (honestly, when have I ever linked to them?) called
  \"<a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6886845/\">How to Get That Perfect Shave</a>\"
  - an article detailing the old-fashioned 'wet shave'.  Amusingly enough, a lot of
  the concepts covered in the article were similar to lessons I'd learned from my
  dad, then forgotten, then learned again when I <a href=\"http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-wet-shave\">checked
  the internet to try to figure out what the hell I was doing</a>. \n\nChances are,
  I'm not going to go whole-hog and try the old-fashioned double-edged safety razor
  with a brush and expensive shaving cream- but I'm at least open to the concept,
  and if I see some of that stuff for a decent price in my wanderings, I'll pick them
  up and give them a try."
