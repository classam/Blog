content: ! "<img src=\"http://internal.tbi.net/~max/snap017.jpg\" alt=\"Error\" />\n\nAt
  this point in the day, I've had over 7,000 visitors to my website! That's more visitors
  than MovieSet.com has recieved this month! \n\nOkay, I'll admit, it all seems to
  be based on the fact that I had an obscure indie Electronica album sitting in the
  site's heirarchy (I had to distribute it to a bunch of my computers)... soaking
  up 4 gigs a day of my precious bandwidth and getting my hit-count into the double-digits.
  I felt bad- I mean, stealing music from the Rolling Stones or software from Adobe
  is okay (Go cry to your billions of dollars), but <a href=\"http://www.venushum.com/\">Venus
  Hum</a>? They're practically a mom & pop institution! \n\nOn top of that, I'm not
  sure if I want to endorse copyright violation on a site that is so aggressively
  branded with my name, especially when I'm trying to get a job with companies who
  sell software. (a veritable storm of strong opinions about copyright violations
  that I don't even want to get into)\n\nSo there will be no more of that- the only
  remaining music on my site is <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/comics/music/\">so
  bad that it needs all of the press it can get</a>.\n\nIf you're lookin' for some
  Venus Hum music.. go to <a href=\"http://www.venushum.com\">their website</a>: They
  give some away for free, and it's good. If you're looking for the Colors of the
  Wheel CD, you'll have to hunt down a torrent."
