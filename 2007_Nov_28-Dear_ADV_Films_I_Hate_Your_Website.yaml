content: ! "Dear ADV Films:\n\nI'm having trouble with your website.\n\nI'm just quickly
  going to outline the process of placing an order, from my standpoint.\n\nFinding
  collections on your site was a difficult process at best.  Searching for the word
  'collection' didn't produce very good results. I eventually made do by searching
  for the word 'complete'- being that that word seems to appear in most of your collections.\n\nYour
  'add to cart' button is a tiny shopping cart. Clever move. \n\nHaving added something
  to my cart, getting back to search results is a chore.\n\nCheckout started out with
  the customary 'giving you every possible piece of information about me', just shy
  of my blood type and obscure sexual preferences.  \n\nClicking 'same as billing
  address' for the shipping address reloads the page. Fun. Selecting a payment method
  accomplishes nothing- all I get is a Javascript error. \n\n<blockquote >\nuncaught
  exception: Security Error: Content at https://www.advfilms.com/Cart/BillingInfo/tabid/90/Default.aspx
  may not load data from http://www.advfilms.com/DesktopModules/ListX/xListing.IM.aspx?lxC=0&lxP=0&\nlxS=lx&lxSrc=dnn_ctr488_xListing&pt=V&tabid=90&mid=488&tmid=178&RA=61526975
  \n</blockquote>\n\nOkay. Great.\n\nClicking 'continue', I'm taken to a screen complaining
  that I've failed to complete the \"Payment Information\" form. Which, of course,
  is true, because the form died just moments ago.  Filling in my payment information,
  I'm taken back to the same screen, once again complaining that I've failed to complete
  the \"Payment Information\" form- not in a pleasant or user-friendly manner, mind
  you, like so:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe following errors were identified: [ValidationMes,CheckCreditCardFields]\n</blockquote>\n\nClassy.
  Classy. \n\nIt also kept needlessly insisting that my credit-card number have no
  spaces or dashes. Of course I had (in fact) entered my credit-card number without
  any spaces or dashes- but even so, why bother me with such a request when a single
  line of code on your end could remove the dashes and the spaces from my credit card
  number? \n\nNevertheless, I'm stuck here. I can't order what I want to order, because
  your form won't let me. Even clicking on the 'Continue Shopping' button returns
  me to the same broken billing page. \n\nOkay, let's try placing the entire order
  again from scratch in Internet Explorer. (I use FireFox as my primary browser, alongside
  40% of internet browsers.) \n\nRe-purchasing every item was fun. It gave me valuable
  time to reconsider some of my more impulsive purchases and pare down my order a
  bit.  This whole process was made more entertaining by the glacial slowness of the
  website.\n\nOkay, and, checking out again. Except this time, my e-mail address is
  already within the system.  So I guess I didn't have to re-find all of my purchases
  after all- except now I have to go back and check to make sure that my cart doesn't
  have double-the-items in it. Okay, I click the \"Continue Shopping\" button, and
  it takes me to a page saying \"Server Error in / Application\" in bright red letters.
  Nice.\n\nThrough some crookery, I find my way back to the main page and -lo and
  behold-, I have a double-sized order sitting in my cart. Delete delete delete. \n\nOkay,
  once again, let's try \"Checkout Now\". Okay, good, you've saved my shipping information.
  Thank you. \n\nOkay, and.. \"Visa\". Nothing.  I'm using Internet Explorer 7, so
  it doesn't have the common courtesy to tell me when something has failed. \n\nI
  want to give you money in exchange for goods and services. Please don't make this
  process any harder than is has to be. "
