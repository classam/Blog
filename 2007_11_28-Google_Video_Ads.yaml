  fact, according to <a href=\"http://adsense.blogspot.com/2006/05/video-ads-your-questions-answered_26.html\">this
  introductory blog post</a> from Google, it's apparently been around for almost a
  full year.  It's built around their acquired YouTube technology, and advertisers
  can pay to have their video commercials featured on websites with similar content.
  Hooray!\n\nThe thing is, I haven't actually seen this appear on a lot of websites.
  I think it's pretty cool- and although I usually find video ads on websites incredibly
  irritating and intrusive, these are opt-in YouTube-style video ads that are potentially,
  theoretically related to the content on the site.  So why haven't I seen more of
  these on the interwebs? Do they have a poor track record of payments? Are they incredibly
  intrusive and irritating? What's the deal?\n\nI thought it would be worth a try
  to get them up and running on my website- a process that was pretty easy, overall.
  I gave it a few initial hints as to the content of my site, and a few false positives
  that would make for entertaining commercials ('web', 'software', 'cooking', 'sushi',
  'development'...) and popped the ads at the permanent location of 'between the first
  and second post'.  Then, I watched a few of the ads myself to see what came up-
  nothing really 'ad-like'- they're more like standard you-tube clips. I guess I'm
  not getting paid for those- Google AdSense made it clear that some unknown percentage
  of the content is not advertising.\n\nI thought \"Cooking With Dave\" was pretty
  hilarious, actually- and there was a barbeque show that was funny just because of
  it's country-western-rustic-Ford-truck-steak-potatoes-and-axle-grease twang.  I
  didn't watch the whole thing, because it was long, but I was seriously expecting
  a gunfight to break out at any moment. \"Now that's a good rib-eye\".\n\nAs one
  complaint,  it seems to think I have something to do with cars.  Clearly they don't
  know me very well- Curtis Lassam: Not A Car Guy At All. I wonder if I can change
  that in the settings somewhere. \n\nYeah, it's time to turn my meagre 20 hits a
  day into pennies, nay, nickels a month! Soon, I shall control the internet, and
  all within it! "
