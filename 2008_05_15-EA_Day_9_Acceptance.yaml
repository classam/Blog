content: ! "Okay, gradually, I'm determining that the codebase that I'm working on
  isn't so bad. \n\nAt first I thought it was ugly and cryptic- a hacked-together
  mess.  I reserved judgement- complaining about other people's code on your first
  day is unprofessional at best- and it might actually be laid out in a sensible fashion
  that I'm just not grasping.  All coders innately hate unfamiliar code, so I try
  to give things more of a chance. \n\nAnd I discovered that this codebase, it's a
  hacked-together mess.  But it's that doesn't have a lot of bugs, maintains a lot
  of internal consistency, and uses functions and classes in a reasonable fashion.
  \ \n\nCompare this with the PHP App that I was handed at Research in Motion to maintain-
  an amateurish set of 'scripts', only loosely connected- and this system seems downright
  pleasant.  Sure there are a lot of ugly decisions, sure there are messy hacks and
  a lot of things are structurally wrong- but it's all wrong in a consistent way,
  so once you understand why it's wrong you can adopt it's messy hacks and bad structuring
  yourself and make it work.\n\nThe worst part is that I'm trying to be subtly wrong
  in the same way as the last coder, because the internal consistency of the bad architecture
  is a strong point of the system, and if I were to rebuild a single file or class
  to make more sense, I'd be compromising a major feature of the system. \n\nSo..
  this is good, or bad? I don't know.  I'm at least having some fun with it.  Maybe
  if I'm lucky I'll get to architecture something from scratch. "
