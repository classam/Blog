content: ! "For those of you who haven't heard, I'm working at Electronic Arts this
  semester. \n\nYes, I've heard the rumours.\n\nThe first day was almost a parallel
  experience to the first day at Research in Motion.  Sit in a big room, have people
  talk at you. Everything that RIM did for it's employees, though, EA has done either
  bigger or better- at least so far.  \n\nI'm under a pretty stringent NDA, so I'm
  keeping quiet about specific details. Fortunately, I don't really have any, anyways-
  except boring contract stuff, and you wouldn't want to see that anyways. \n\nWe
  started with a Development Designer or Project Development Developer or Captain
  Develeperino or whatever his title was.  He went through the standard \"Oh me, I'm
  so fine, I'm so fine I blow my mind hey me\" executive self-jerkery, and then quickly
  gave all of us a quick overview of the development cycle for games, described with
  the sort of gushing effluence of a man who's clearly been championing the process
  for some time.  He defended it as a way to control costs more effectively- surely
  the way to win a developer's heart.  Nothing gets me soggy in the pants like hearing
  about how I can help somebody else make a tonne of money. \n\nLunch was a generic
  sandwich-triangle-buffet fare- but I was actually surprised at the quality of the
  sandwiches.  With obscure ingredients like 'horseradish' and 'jalapenos', clearly
  at least a little bit of love and care went into these sammitches. There were also
  devilled eggs and little cookies, and smoked salmon.\n\nAfter lunch, the security
  and signing of forms.  classam, 05/05/08.  classam, 05/05/08.  classam, 05/05/08.
  \ After reading the assorted contracts, I no longer have any legal rights as a human
  being, and should EA want to clone my DNA to produce a human clone of me to perform
  as a slave, I'm sure they could.\n\nThen the EA tour.  EA has facilities like Italy
  has pasta- all over the place, and guarded by stout Italian women.  That simile
  might need some work. The numerous sports-courts are impressive, but none of my
  chubby, lazy business. At best I'll use the nice little gym a couple of times per
  week. At best. \n\nNo, I'm an arcade man.  \n\nThe most interesting EA service would
  be EA University- a variety of courses from prominent EA techies, artists, and producers
  about technology, art, and production.  If I can clear it with my manager, I'm taking
  everything in the EAU pantheon that's available during the summer.  That and my
  CMPT 470 course should keep me busy this semester. \n\nFinally, the co-op advisor
  giving us the old fashioned \"How to be successful in your co-op\" talk.  I think
  I've heard 'you get out of it what you put in to it' quite a few times by now. \n\nThen,
  IT policy, which can be summarized as follows: \"No.\" \n\nJust getting some decent
  jams to listen to while at work is going to be a significant production involving
  at least three people, a trained acrobat, and a heist of epic proportions.  (Or
  maybe just a write-only DVD, we'll see.)\n\n<a href=\"http://www.jansepar.com/\">Shawn
  Jansepar</a>  was there, too.  He seemed a lot more excited about the whole process
  than I was- perhaps because it was his first time with corporate shenanigans like
  this. "
