  />\n\nSo, I've been fiddling with this code for a few days- fixing bugs, reorganizing
  things, what-have-you.  \n\nThere hasn't been a lot of excitement, lately.  I've
  worked, come home, eaten dinner, repeat-as-necessary. \n\nToday was a bit interesting,
  though.  First of all, I took my lunch break and went to the University of Waterloo
  Surplus Sale with a co-worker of mine.  He didn't want to go, but I requested that
  he come anyways and help my haul any big purchases home.  The place was full of
  desks and tables and chairs and bicycles and monitors for $1-5 each. As soon as
  the doors open, a huge line of people ran in and basically stood right next to the
  first item they wanted, waiting for a salesperson to come along and ring them up.
  I'd have bought a bike ($2), but my arms were full with a 1700MhZ P4 + 256Mb RAM
  + 40Gb HDD for $101, which seemed like about what I wanted to pay for just those
  things. The bikes didn't look very good anyways. \n\nIan drove me and the computer
  junk over to my house, then back to work. The whole operation took about 40 minutes
  (Keep in mind I live very, very close to where I work.)\n\nThen, after that, I had
  a meeting with my boss. I described in detail what my plan for the code was, and
  he was generally amenable to the whole list of changes, very relaxed attitude.  I
  have free reign for the next few weeks to refactor the code as I please, cleaning
  things up and moving blocks of related functionality into classes.  Past that, there's
  some minor development planned.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, my boss (Clint) invited
  me back for another semester after this one- if RIM has this position to fill, he
  wants me filling it.\n\nSo.. do I want to stay for 8 months?  I'd have to make the
  decision in about the next 2 weeks, if I want to stay in the same house and work
  in the same position. \n\nI don't quite know yet. "
