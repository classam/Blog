content: ! "Okay, so, <a href=\"http://potater.com/\">Potater</a> was fun to build
  (a lot of fun to build, really), sort of fun to run for a month, but it's not really
  picking up any sort of audience, it's a lot of work, and it's actually decreasing
  my overall enjoyment of Google Reader. \n\nKerry pointed out that - why follow my
  potater if everything shows up in my Google Shared items, anyways?  Well, uh, yeah.
  \n\nReally, Potater was more \"Curtis having fun with web design and tooling about
  in Python\" then it was an idea for a long-lasting project. \n\nSo, I think that's
  about it for the Potater Top 10. \n\nIf you're not already following my Google Shared
  items - perhaps you don't even use Google Reader (shame on you) - you can get exactly
  the same content that you got from Potater, witty asides and all, from <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user%2F07819160697092147323%2Fstate%2Fcom.google%2Fbroadcast\">here</a>.
  (Okay, it's less easy to remember than 'potater', but... ) \n\nI still love the
  domain name 'potater' - it's memorable and fun.  I wonder what I'll put there, next..."
