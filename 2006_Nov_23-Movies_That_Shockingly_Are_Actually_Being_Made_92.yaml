  CRYPTID


  Snowy mountains and a dying mining town are the setting for this horror-thriller
  about a failed zoologist with a life-long obsession to find the CRYPTID that killed
  her father.

  &amp;amp;gt; once prosperous gold town is shutting down, leaving behind only

  &amp;amp;gt; Frankie, her team of animal control officers and a mysterious hitch
