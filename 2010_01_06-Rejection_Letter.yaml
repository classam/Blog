content: ! "Dear Mr. Lassam.\n\nWe regret to inform you that we have decided to pass
  on your screenplay for the next Bond film.  While we normally do not go into further
  detail in rejection letters, we feel that your... <em>exceptional</em> screenplay
  showed some fundamental misunderstandings of both the James Bond canon and the basics
  of screenwriting. Please take the following under consideration: \n\n<ul>\n<li>
  \"Dongs Aplenty\" is not an appropriate name for a Bond girl. </li>\n<li> Your request
  that the character Dongs Aplenty be played by \"The head of Alyson Hannigan grafted
  on to the bodies of the 2010 Olympic Figure Skating Team\", would be impossible,
  and the thought of it is more than a little bit disturbing. </li>\n<li> While your
  twelve-page rumination on Borscht does lead in to a pretty solid pun on the state
  of Russian Politics, remember that one page in a screenplay should correspond to
  roughly 1 minute of screen time.  We feel that 12 minutes of soup-jokes may be lost
  on some of our more action-oriented audiences. </li>\n<li> You seem to be confusing
  James Bond with Sean Connery in scenes four through seven, and, even more confusingly,
  with Roger Moore in scenes nine through twelve. </li> \n<li> While it certainly
  sounds ominous, there is, to the best of our knowledge, no country called \"Belarussiafghanistanbul\".
  </li>\n<li> \"Dongs Aplenty\" is not an appropriate name for a Bond Villain. </li>\n<li>
  While greasy, ink-stained napkins that smell suspiciously of chicken <em>do</em>
  convey the tone of your story rather well, in the future, we would prefer that all
  manuscripts be typed, in 11pt Times New Roman, in a standard screenwriting style.
  \ </li>\n<li> Your being a family friend does not entitle you to 'one free movie,
  to show Hollywood what you've got'.  This screenplay would literally ruin our careers
  forever, as well as the careers of anybody who it may touch. </li>\n<li> As far
  as we can tell, you've named every character in your screenplay \"Dongs Aplenty\".
  This may make it difficult to differentiate between critical story characters.  As
  well, the Vice Prime Minister of Belarussiafghanistanbul, Dongs Aplenty, and the
  Master Proletariat of Cuba, Dongs Aplenty - are they related? It's not made clear
  by the story. </li> \n<li> While Judi Dench has been known to play Dungeons and
  Dragons, this is not a trait of the character \"M\". </li>\n<li> The entire bar-fight
  scene is just the word 'vespa', repeated 293 times, followed by \"PUNCHO PUNCHO!\".
  \ We are curious as to what you mean by this. </li> \n<li> James Bond does not ride
  a unicorn. </li> \n</ul>\n\nIn lieu of commenting on the screenplay and returning
  it to you, we have had it burned.\n\nThank You For Your Time. \n-- Ryan Aplenty"
