  My company is incapable of understanding software development, and so likes to change
  things endlessly in mid-development.  The company doing our software development
  likes to look frustrated, then charge out the nose for such a privelige.  Our company
  then likes to complain about how they''ve missed a bunch of deadlines and are charging
  us out the nose.


  When your entire business model revolves around a website, perhaps it is wise to
  construct said website oneself. Alternatively, given the boss''s apparent and lordly
  assessment of the skills of ''computer people'', she''d probably hire 2 co-ops to
  do it in a week.


  I''m just happy when I have some free time to set down reams of documentation (Documentation
  that is overwhelmingly represented by ''to be filled in later'' types of comments),
  stop fiddling with the insanity-generating randomly-located XSL code in our frustrating
  CMS, and relax writing a Python script to parse registration information from a
  .csv file into a demographic report. Python is the best thing ever.'
