content: ! "I may have neglected to post this at any point- \n\nNext semester, and
  the semester after that, I'll be working for \"<a href=\"http://www.humanaturestudio.com/\">Humanature
  Studios</a>\" as a software dev, for an 8-month co-op.  \n\nHumanature is a division
  of Nexon, an Asian MMO supercompany.  One of their games claims to have over 76,000,000
  registered users.  Noting that the entire population of Canada is about 34 million
  or so people, that's ... a little strange, actually.  Even WoW only has 10 million
  subscribers. (Over half of those subscribers are from Asia, though)  They've gotta
  be fudging that number a little. 76 million? No way. \n\nBut while Nexon is apparently
  Bigger Than Superjesus, Humanature is a really-very-small company.  They take up
  about one floor, and things seem to happen with a minimum of horrifying bureaucracy.\n\nI
  have high hopes for this co-op. Fingers crossed. "
