  />\n\nWelcome to the School of Interactive Arts and Technology! \nYou've just become
  a part of SFU's most groundbreaking and innovative school, which is why nobody in
  the universe understands what it is that you do or why your degree matters.\n\nDon't
  speak English? No problem- TECH 100 and TECH 101 will handle your University-Level
  English requirements, and you don't even need to know how to string together a sentence!
  \nDon't like Math? Worry not- you can take that \"Special\" calculus reserved for
  Arts students!\n\nWhat about code? I bet you don't like that either. Don't worry,
  you won't need to know too much of that, either. Just enough to cobble together
  a website in Dreamweaver or Flash.\n\nHere are some guidelines for your upcoming
  degree!\n\n<strong>1. Show Up</strong>\n\t\n\tThe first step is, of course, showing
  up.  You might need also to get into the program, but this is considered to be a
  trivial task.\n\n<strong>2. Build Websites </strong>\n\n\tOnce you're in, you are
  going to need to build some websites.  Learn Dreamweaver and Flash, and maybe the
  basics of HTML code.  If you're especially clever, you might even want to learn
  how to put together a MySQL query or some ActionScript- but don't overextend yourself:
  Hard stuff like that is for <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/2007/05/30/if-i-could-change-the-cs-department/\">CS
  majors</a>!\n\n<strong>3. Get a Degree </strong>\n\n\tThis one is harder than you
  might think.  Because the other members of your faculty keep insisting that they
  won't give you a degree until you actually *LEARN* something, the requirements of
  your degree will keep consistently changing. Getting a degree will be about as difficult
  as nailing Jello to a greased-up orphan.  When you do, you can be proud that you
  finally picked up a degree in something! \n\n<strong>4. Find a Job</strong>\n\n\tCongratulations!
  Now that you have a SIAT degree, you have the freedom to bullshit your way into
  any number of exciting positions. Web designer? Interaction designer? Graphic designer?
  They're all good choices!  Of course, they're all things that you do exactly the
  same way that you did coming out of high-school, but you have that all-important
  piece of paper saying that you are a whiz-kid at Interactive Something Something.
  Enjoy!\n"
