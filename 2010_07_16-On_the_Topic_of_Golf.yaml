  articles expound endlessly on a topic that is completely and utterly ridiculous.</em>\n\nGood
  afternoon, the internet.  I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of linksmanship, have
  just played my first game of actual golf.\n\nMy preconceptions as to what an actual
  golf game would entail were entirely wrong.  Mini-golf has little windmills and
  clowns and ample bank-shots - I was hoping that full-sized golf would have enormous
  windmills and clowns the size of commuter buses. Boy was I wrong. The clowns are
  actually, at best, 8-9 feet across.  \n\nThe game of golf goes pretty much as follows;
  first, the golfer lines up his shot using a series of difficult calculations that
  include distance, wind-speed, slope, and a variable called 'dx' which nobody really
  understands.  Then, the golfer attempts to swing a club at his ball in exactly the
  manner that professionals would.  This step involves a lot of anecdotal, contradictory
  instructions - instructions like \"Keep your arm straight\", \"Tuck your chin in\",
  \"Eyes on the ball\", \"No, not that ball, the one you're trying to hit\", \"Bend
  your knees\", \"Ask your cohorts to bend their knees, too\", \"Don't pull back too
  far\", \"Follow through\", \"Be a man\", and \"Grow a beard.\"  No amount of slavish
  devotion to this complicated ruleset will actually allow the golfer to hit the ball
  in the direction that he has imagined. This is because the ball is tiny, and the
  surface area on the club devoted to 'whacking' is similarly tiny.\n\nThus, we have
  the third step: The golfer must attempt to find his ball.  \n\n\"Walking towards
  the golf ball\" is easily the most time-consuming step of golf, right behind \"consuming
  refreshing beverages\" and \"waiting for the team in front of you.\"  But don't
  worry - after all of that walking, the enormous windmills will cool you off. "
