content: ! "Recently, I'm involved in a new project. I'm calling it \"Project Don't
  Die Before I Reach The Age Of 28\", or \"PDDBIRTAO28\" for short. \n\nThe real purpose
  of the project is to try to kill some of my more egregiously unhealthy habits.  Convenience-store
  corn-dogs? Yeah, that's one of them.  This project isn't out of any real desire
  to be more attractive or fit- like I said before, it's out of a desire to outlive
  most household pets. \n\nThe first phase of my project has been the consumption
  of vegetables.  This isn't like some sort of serious mostly-vegetarianism where
  I consume a little bit of chicken once per week and abstain the rest of the time.
  \ No, this phase is merely \"eat vegetables\".  Shockingly enough, I've discovered
  that my diet is almost completely dominated by meat, fat, and starch.  Spending
  time at Kristen's house doesn't help, either- Kristen's mom is a cook in the good
  old-fashioned \"Meat and potatoes\" sense.  SFU is no better, being that my two
  biggest lunch orders are <acronym title=\"oh YEAH.\">capicolo panini</acronym> and
  sushi.\n\nThis has involved eating vegetables at home- the sort of vegetables one
  finds in the fridge, celery, carrots, cucumber, tomatoes, that sort of thing. Often
  with dip, or tzatziki, or salt and pepper, just to keep them from being healthy.
  They're more delicious that way. Quiet, you!  Also, occasionally, packing vegetables
  with me and snacking on them at school.\n\nThe thing about it, though, is that while
  vegetarians often comment about experiencing gastrointestinal distress when faced
  with a sudden influx of greasy meatiness, I've experienced a similar set of recent
  problems with the vegetables.  I mean, I've felt better than usual, but I need to
  eat three times as many vegetables to feel full- and then way more often. On top
  of that, all of this sudden foliage is messin' with my stomach. Ah well, I'm sure
  it'll be good for me.\n\nI know at least two of the people who read this blog are
  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexitarian\">vegetarians-or-close</a> -
  and I'm sure 100% of the people who read this blog eat healthier than I do.  So..
  how do you work more vegetables into your day-to-day schedule?  How do you make
  them taste less like watery fibrous chunks or bitter roots? "
