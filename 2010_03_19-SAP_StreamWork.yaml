content: ! "So, Phil's project at SAP has finally launched! \n\nWhen it was in beta,
  it was called \"12sprints\", which sounds like sort of a post-37signals Web 2.0
  name for collaboration software that doesn't really do anything.  If I were a customer,
  I'd just go with 37signals.  Why? <em>They're 25 higher!</em>. Ba dum-tsh.\n\nIt's
  critical, when naming your product, not to put yourself down like that. Phil's team
  should have called it \"74sprints\" - that way, if somebody asked them about the
  name, they could at least claim to be twice as good as 37signals.\n\nSo, they had
  to drop \"12sprints\" and go with the new name, \"SAP StreamWork\".  We've gone
  from a meaningless Web 2.0 name to a meaningless Enterprise name.  SAP StreamWork.
  \ Well, I was just about to <em>work on some streams</em>, perhaps this software
  will be useful to me. \n\nLet's look at <a href=\"http://www.sapstreamwork.com/\">the
  front page</a>, shall we?\n\nNow let's imagine that I have a big red marker, and
  I can draw RIGHT ON THAT WEBSITE. What will I draw? Well, <a href=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/images/sap_streamwork_1.png\">this</a>.
  \n\nI want to know about this product.  Let's extract every last juicy tidbit of
  information from the front page.  \n\nLooking at the whole page, the only words
  that seem to describe what the software actually <em>does</em> are \"Share documents
  and data\", and \"Tools for brainstorming and decision-making\". Mmm. It's collaboration
  software.  Collaboration software? Never heard of it - they do, after all, claim
  to be \"the <a title=\"37signals\" href=\"http://37signals.com/\">first</a> <a title=\"Sharepoint\"
  href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharepoint\">and</a> <a title=\"Google Wave\"
  href=\"http://wave.google.com/about.html\">only</a> <a title=\"Everything Else\"
  href=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/images/business_collaboration_software.png\">solution</a>\".\n\nIf
  we want to learn more, we're going to have to go on the tour that they've provided.
  \ It's on YouTube, how bad could it be?\n\nIt's a ... uh... Powerpoint Presentation.
  \ Without any voice. There's a guitar, though. GUITAR TUNES.  We start with <em>sweeping
  generalities</em> and move to <em>confusing, directionless screenshots</em>.\n\nOkay,
  I still have no idea what the hell it is that this software does. On to the <a href=\"http://www.sapstreamwork.com/features/\">features</a>
  page! \n\nI've taken the liberty of <a href=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/images/sap_streamwork_2.png\">cutting
  out all of the business mumbo jumbo from this page, to make it a little bit more
  readable</a>. \n\nThe first feature that they mention on the page is \"notifications,
  activity streams, and action items\".  Oh, I'm sold.  Just this morning, over an
  Egg McMuffin and a orange juice, I was saying to my friends, \"do you know what
  my day is missing?\". \n\n\"What?\", they asked.\n\n\"Activity streams.\" \n\n\"Oh,
  man, you have <em>got</em> to get some activity streams, \" my friends told me.
  \"They are awesome.  But at least you have action items, right? \" \n\nShit.  I
  am a dude without Action Items or Activity Streams.  Do you see the trouble that
  I am in? Already, this software is right for me. \n\nBut it would be prudent to
  explore further.  Next, we have integration with a variety of products that business
  people know how to use and are unwilling to part with. \"Outlook Integration!\",
  they will go. \"I use Outlook <em>all the time!</em> Once I get the IT guys to configure
  it properly, it's pretty much the only software I know how to use, except for that
  Internet thing!\"  Okay, bam, bonus here.\n\nThe next point is that \"all discussions,
  information, feedback, methods, and decisions are saved and can be shared or re-used.\"
  \  Okay, so I'm still not sure what it is that the product <em>does</em>, but I
  know that when it does it, it will do it with <u>Action Streams</u>, it will integrate
  with my <u>Outlook</u>, and it'll <u>Save a Copy</u>.  Somehow, this combination
  of features will allow me to <u>drive to a resolution</u>. Excellent.\n\nOkay, I'm
  not getting anywhere with this.  On to the tutorials. Maybe they will tell me what
  this product does.\n\n<strong>Creating an Activity.</strong>  Oh, maybe we will
  find out what an Activity is! Apparetly, an Activity aids in the process of decision-making
  by:\n<ul>\n<li>Eliminating long, hard-to-follow e-mail threads. <small>You know,
  like Gmail. Or properly configured mailing lists. Or Google Groups. Or IRC. </small></li>\n<li>Providing
  a workspace conducive to collaborative decision making. <small>Have you tried open
  spaces and whiteboards?</small></li>\n<li>Giving the user powerful tools that guide
  the decision-making process. <small>You mean, like, common sense? </small> </li>\n</ul>\n\nAnd
  then, what happens afterwards is some sort of ... thing.  The part of my brain that
  says 'couldn't this all just be resolved with a discussion?' would likely shut down
  if I watched any more of these tutorials.  \n\nOkay, I give up, I can't figure out
  what the heck this product is good for.  Heck, I could probably build better collaboration
  software myself - it'd need to be easy, flexible, well-understood by developers,
  synchronous to allow for discussion, group-inclusive, and keep a record of past
  discussions.  You know, like IRC with a decent <a href=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/pierc/\">logger</a>.
  \n\n\n\n\n\n"
