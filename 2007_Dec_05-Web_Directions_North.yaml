  crowd. <a href=\"http://www.blastradius.com/#/HOME/1/\">Blast Radius</a>, <a href=\"http://www.icesoft.com/\">IceSoft</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.bryght.com/\">Bryght</a>, <a href=\"http://www.raincitystudios.com/\">RainCity
  Studios</a>, <a href=\"http://www.in-vancouver.com/\">inVancouver Design</a>, and
  countless others, including lots of lesser-known startups like Steve Hannah's <a
  href=\"http://www.weblite.ca/\">Web-Lite Solutions</a> and the indomitable <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=38\">MovieSet.com</a>.
  \ Heck, I might even start my own web company, once I've classed up my web skills
  a bit- and why not in Vancouver?\n\nA web conference has appeared! Curtis used 'register'!
  The attack was super effective! Curtis has defeated web conference! Curtis has reached
  lvl. 2! \n\nThe \"<a href=\"http://north08.webdirections.org/\">Web Directions North</a>\"
  conference will be held in late January.  It's two days of expensive workshops that
  I'm not going to attend (They sound awesome, but a day of knowledge for $400? That's
  as much as 4 months of knowledge from the SFU), followed by two days of lectures
  from assorted Vancouver websy types and assorted non-Vancouver websy types.  There
  are topics that I'm actually interested in - from \"<a href=\"http://north08.webdirections.org/schedule/#elam\">Five
  Essential Composition Tools for Web Typography</a>\" to \"<a href=\"http://north08.webdirections.org/schedule/#williams\">Design
  As A Business</a>\" to \"<a href=\"http://north08.webdirections.org/schedule/#spool\">What
  Makes a Design Seem Intuitive</a>.\"\n\nOf course, there are also the obligatory
  <a title=\"Government 2.0. HA!\" href=\"http://north08.webdirections.org/schedule/#hunt\">talks
  where people jerk off to the words \"Web 2.0\" and talk about how the internet is
  going to change everybody's life</a>. But then, you can't get a group of forward
  thinking people in a room without someone starting to run off at the mouth about
  how the internet's new buzzword is going to change the universe, so really your
  best recourse is to just ignore them and take the opportunity to get yourself a
  good sammitch.\n\nAfter the conference, there will be a day of skiing at Whistler-
  either on the Friday, or the Saturday- I guess, depending on whether you're a Vancouver
  native who probably plans to work Friday and ski Saturday or a tourist who plans
  to go home as soon as the conference is over. (For me, it's skiing on the Saturday.)
  \n\nThe cost for the conference is a wallet-busting $795, not including the skiing
  (an additional $120) or the conferences (an additional $400, each)- and that's the
  early-bird pricing. A dubious value, at best- I mean, going to conferences like
  this is a great way to network with professionals, increase your skills (Girls only
  want boyfriends who have great skills) , and show potential employers that you're
  the type of guy who constantly seeks self-improvement.  But $920? Fortunately, if
  you're a student you can take advantage of the \"Student Discount\", bringing the
  conference price to a much-more-pleasant $195. It'll still be another $120 for the
  skiing, but.. hey! Skiing! \n\nSo, the question is.. am I going to see you there?
  Learning about the web, drinking 'the booze', and skiing all over the place, taking
  the time to distribute your cleverly designed business cards to everybody and his
  mother? \n\nOh, crap! I have to design some clever business cards! "
