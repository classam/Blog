content: ! "So, a few months ago, my uncle opened a restaurant.  Tony-O's- just in
  Surrey, on King George highway. \n\nA tonne of money and time went into making the
  place look nice, getting the kitchen up to code, fixing what was essentially a crappy
  little Chinese-food dump into a respectable little cafe. \n\nEverything on the <a
  href=\"http://www.tony-os.com/menu.php\">substantially-sized menu</a>- every last
  thing- was delicious.  Some of you have eaten there- I had a big event there 'round
  September, and I tried to drag people to the restaurant when I had the chance.\n\nDinehere
  had a favourable review of the place, and so did the local newspaper. I stopped
  by now and then, but the in-and-out flow of the place seemed pretty slow. \n\nAnd
  now.. it's closed. Not enough money to stay in business. \n\nI'm a little disappointed-
  My uncle's cooking is highly nom-worthy, expertly executed, good eats.  The ability
  to get it any-time was fantastic, even if the restaurant was a little bit out of
  my way. \n\nBut I can't say I'm overly surprised.  From my first experience with
  the location, foot traffic around the area is almost nil. The people who do walk
  by are not the type I'd categorize as the sort who would go for higher-end food-
  they seem a pretty fast-food bunch.  The bright red canopy and clean, attractive
  little restaurant can only go so far to attract foot traffic that isn't there.\n\nThe
  new condos being built could potentially provide a large burst of higher-end clientele..
  when they're finished. If they finish. That's a year or more down the road, though.\n\nAs
  for King George road- well, it's a major thoroughfare, but that doesn't mean that
  the nook-sized restaurant is going to attract a lot of customers.  The giant \"Food
  experience\" on the banner doesn't help, either- what's a \"Food experience\"? Are
  they going to rub potatoes on my nurps? \n\nGiven that, the little shop had the
  sort of food that could survive with a cult following- good food, good value, what's
  not to like?  Thing is, though, developing a cult following takes time.  If the
  restaurant is out of money after being open for 6 months, either overhead's too
  high, they didn't plan far enough ahead, or both.  As for the overhead- with the
  huge menu, one can only expect that food costs are pretty high.  \n\nOn top of that,
  the restaurant had little-to-no advertising budget and was only open 11-7, Monday
  to Friday- leaving out late-night and weekend eaters, not to mention most 9-5ers.
  \n\nPoor Uncle Antonio- last time I saw him, he just seemed deflated.  I hope his
  next scheme is more successful. \n\n... So, anybody interested in buying a restaurant?
