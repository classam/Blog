  is... <code>foreach</code>.\n\nPHP has it, C# has it, Python has an even better
  implementation of it.. and JavaScript has it, but JavaScript's version doesn't do
  what you think it does.\n\nLook at these two sets of code and tell me which you
  think looks cleaner:\n\n<div class=\"code\">\n// C#\nArrayList list = new List();\nforeach(
  String string in list)\n{\n&nbsp;print string;\n}\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"code\">\n//
  C#\nArrayList list = new List();\nforeach(int i = 0; i < list.length; i++)\n{\n&nbsp;print
  list[i];\n}\n</div>\n\nIn Python, all you have to write is <code> for thing in list:</code>
  to get the same functionality. \n\nThe foreach way is much slicker, 90% of the time.
