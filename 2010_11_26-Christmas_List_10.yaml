content: ! "<ul>\n<li> A subscription to Discover, Scientific American, Popular Science,
  Popular American Scientist, Sciency McScience, SCIENCE! the magazine with explosions!,
  or Popular Explosions. </li>\n<li> Big fuzzy robe and/or pyjamas, so that I don't
  keep flashing the neighbors and experiencing 'freezing cold leather couch' syndrome.</li>\n<li>
  New headphones, to replace 'grainy and broken', 'one-eared', and 'one-eared grainy
  and broken'. I like 'over-the-head' headphones. Noise-cancelling headphones are
  gravy. </li>\n<li> Kitchen knives and a steel. </li>\n<li> Gift cards that I can
  convert into <a href=\"http://crossroadstrading.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/mc-hammer.jpg\">Nice
  Pants</a> and Work Shirts. </li>  \n<li> Things that are delicious. </li> \n<li>
  More soft, comfortable blankets for couches and general loafing. Real, full-sized
  quilts.  </li>\n<li> More sleep, somehow. </li>\n<li> I've always wanted (and by
  'always', I mean 'since I was 16 and discovered that they exist') one of <a href=\"http://www.wacom.com/cintiq/cintiq-12wx.php\">these</a>
  inconceivably expensive bad boys.  So money to put towards that?  </li> \n<li> <a

  upon spices</a>! To celebrate <a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3423420646593881609#\">Snowflake
  Day!</a>  </li>\n<li> Gift certificates from Amazon or Chapters </li> \n</ul>"
