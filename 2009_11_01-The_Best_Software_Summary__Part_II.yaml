  <span class="anchor" id="line-83"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-84"></span><ul><li>In
  software design, the difference in productivity between programmers can be orders
  of magnitude <span class="anchor" id="line-85"></span></li><li>Who are the most
  productive in programming? "Hackers"  <span class="anchor" id="line-86"></span></li><li>Hackers
  want: <span class="anchor" id="line-87"></span><ul><li>Good money (but not ''spectacular
  money'')  <span class="anchor" id="line-88"></span></li><li>Great tools <span class="anchor"
  id="line-89"></span><ul><li><p class="line862">UNIX/Linux, more obscure programming
  languages &lt;-- these attract a different kind of developer.  <span class="anchor"
  id="line-90"></span></li><li>Open-source software (so that they can fix it if it
  breaks) <span class="anchor" id="line-91"></span></li><li>To find the _real_ tools
  to use, look at the tools your developers use in their spare time.  (GIT/Python)  <span
  class="anchor" id="line-92"></span></li></ul></li><li>Offices <span class="anchor"
  id="line-93"></span><ul><li>Places to pace, to read, to nap, to doodle and fiddle
  and problem-solve <span class="anchor" id="line-94"></span></li></ul></li><li>Interesting
  Projects <span class="anchor" id="line-95"></span><ul><li>Search was boring, until
  Google redefined it as an Interesting Project <span class="anchor" id="line-96"></span></li><li>Steve
  Jobs made Apple development difficult by having high standards and asking developers
  to make it beautiful.  <span class="anchor" id="line-97"></span></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Non-hackers
  can''t determine who''s a hacker- they''re easy to take advantage of? <span class="anchor"
  id="line-98"></span></li><li>Hackers like problems that are big and hard - research
  and what-have-you, not problems that are small and nasty, like ''bugs''.  <span
  class="anchor" id="line-99"></span><ul><li>One doesn''t learn anything from "Nasty
  Little Problems", so hackers avoid them. <span class="anchor" id="line-100"></span><ul><li><p
  class="line862">Large companies put the smart people in R&amp;D <span class="anchor"
  id="line-101"></span></li><li><p class="line862">Small companies put the smart people
  in charge of tools &amp; libraries <span class="anchor" id="line-102"></span><ul><li>In
  this way, Junior and Weaker developers just have to snap well-constructed components
  together with glue code.  <span class="anchor" id="line-103"></span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>High
  tech areas spring up around universities - there''s an endless supply of smart hacker
  types. <span class="anchor" id="line-104"></span></li><li>It''s hard to tell who''s
  a great hacker- or even if you are a great hacker.   <span class="anchor" id="line-105"></span></li><li>How
  to be a hacker? <span class="anchor" id="line-106"></span><ul><li><p class="line862">It''s
  important to be smart, of course, but it''s more important to be <em>curious</em>
  <span class="anchor" id="line-107"></span></li><li><p class="line862">Hackers have
  to <em>concentrate</em> <span class="anchor" id="line-108"></span></li><li>"Never
  work on boring projects, but never do a half-assed job." <span class="anchor" id="line-109"></span><span

  class="gap">Starbucks maintains a separate, asynchronous Cashier (to take orders
  and money) and Barista (to fill orders) <span class="anchor" id="line-126"></span></li><li>Timing:
  In order to be maximally efficient, Baristas often do similar drinks in batches
  - which means that certain customers get drinks before others. <span class="anchor"
  id="line-127"></span></li><li>Correlation: With an asynchronous process like this,
  matching cup-to-customer is difficult. Starbucks either takes down a name or does
  it by drink-type. <span class="anchor" id="line-128"></span></li><li>Exception Handling:  <span
  class="anchor" id="line-129"></span><ul><li>Write-Off: If a drink is abandoned or
  not-paid for, it is discarded. <span class="anchor" id="line-130"></span></li><li>Retry:
  If a drink is made improperly, it is remade <span class="anchor" id="line-131"></span></li><li>Compensating
  Action: If a drink is unavailable, it is refunded.  <span class="anchor" id="line-132"></span></li></ul></li><li>Two
  Phase Commit: The customer would have the money on the table, the cashier would
  place the drink on the table, and then the drink and money would swap.  This is
  ''simple'', but it processes orders much more slowly.  <span class="anchor" id="line-133"></span></li><li><p

  <span class="anchor" id="line-140"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-141"></span><ul><li>I
  want to stay the course with the people who converse with me, not just drift away
  as if no longer interested. <span class="anchor" id="line-142"></span></li><li>I
  want to argue passionately without rancor, let you call me names in the morning
  and drink in peace and affection with me that night. <span class="anchor" id="line-143"></span></li><li>I
  want to hold others in the true respect that allows them to be what they are, act
  like they will, while working as hard as possible to influence them to try other
  things. <span class="anchor" id="line-144"></span></li><li>I want to give my ideas
  away, confident that my little gift will come back to me manyfold. <span class="anchor"
  id="line-145"></span></li><li>I want to try every way I can to communicate with
  my colleagues, to get my ideas across and to get their ideas back in return. <span
  class="anchor" id="line-146"></span></li><li>I want to honor the passion that people
  feel, to honor the strongly held beliefs and ideas of others as much as I honor
  my own <span class="anchor" id="line-147"></span></li><li>I want to crash-test those
  beliefs and ideas hard against each other, confident that even better ideas will
  come out of the testing. <span class="anchor" id="line-148"></span></li><li>I want
  to assume that we do this from love, that we care about each other, and that we
  welcome the crackle of real passion, real work, the real interaction of ideas. <span

  <span class="anchor" id="line-153"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-154"></span><ul><li>C++
  snuck past the radar to become the dominant programming language <span class="anchor"

  with C dominant  (On a spectrum of Academic to Business, with C in the middle) <span
  class="anchor" id="line-156"></span></li><li>C++ gained popularity as a pile of
  ''additional features'', backwards compatible with C <span class="anchor" id="line-157"></span></li><li>This
  made it popular for C developers to move entire codebases to C++ without much trouble.  <span

  started to use C++ Objects &amp; References &amp; whatnot - now the codebase can''t
