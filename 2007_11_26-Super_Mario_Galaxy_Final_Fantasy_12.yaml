content: ! 'This weekend, I tried a new project.


  Having access to a Wii, a Playstation 2, and an Xbox 360 at my house- yay, roommates,
  I''ve made it a personal goal to play Super Mario Galaxy and Final Fantasy 12 while
  I have the chance.


  I finished Super Mario Galaxy on Saturday, over the course of about 12 hours. Let
  me tell you, everything people have been saying about the game is true. It is, without
  any doubt, the best platformer.  Not the best platformer for the Wii, or the best
  3d platformer, or the best platformer game that I''ve played.  It is the best platform
  game, 2d or 3d, for any system, ever.  That applies into the future, too- it is
  the best platformer that ever will be, at least until Nintendo releases the next
  solid Mario game, 8 years from now.  The controls feel comfortable, the camera is
  always where you want it to be, and the game is bursting with novel concepts and
  gameplay.


  On Sunday, after doing some laundry, I started on Final Fantasy 12.  Now, after
  playing a game of such high quality as Super Mario Galaxy, the slow gameplay of
  Final Fantasy was a bit of a stick at first, but I powered through it.  It''s really
  not so much a ''game'' as it is a long animated serial with occasional breaks where
  you can kill monsters or buy weapons.  No complaints here, though- the story is
  peppy and fun, the characters are interesting, and any game with British accents
  is okay by my books.


  It''s been a long time since I''ve played games- any games, really, and these are
  some of the best of the bunch. I''m having a blast.'
