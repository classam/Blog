content: ! "Windows Live (the current generation of Outlook Express => Windows Mail
  => Whatever) offers the following curious pre-checked box during installation: \n\n\"Set
  Bing as the default search provider in your browser, <em>and prevent programs from
  interfering with this choice.</em>\"\n\n\"Microsoft Choice Guard is a small piece
  of software that's downloaded during the Windows Live installation process to carry
  out any changes that you choose to make to your browser settings. If you choose
  to change your default search engine, Choice Guard looks for any programs on your
  computer that might interfere with this process and works around them to let you
  change your default search engine. Choice Guard does this to help ensure that choosing
  your default search engine is as easy as possible.\"\n\nRight off the bat, a software
  called \"Choice Guard\" has me wary. On one hand, preventing 'malicious programs'
  from setting your homepage to TelusPortal.crap or Toshiba.Aol.blug is probably not
  a bad thing... on the other hand... well... did you <em>read</em> that? "
