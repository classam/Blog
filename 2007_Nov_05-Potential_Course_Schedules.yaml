  type=\"text/css\">\n  .classes\n{\nfont-size: 80%;\npadding: 5px 10px 5px 10px;\n}\n</style>\n\n<h5>
  Bin #1 : The \"Monday Wednesday Friday\"</h5>\n<ul class=\"classes\">\n<li>STAT
  270 (9:30-10:20) - <strong>Introduction to Statistics</strong> </li>\n<li>CMPT  376W
  (11:30 - 12:20 ) - <strong>Technical Writing & Group Dynamics</strong></li>\n<li>CMPT
  384 (1:30-2:20) - <strong> Symbolic Computing </strong></li>\n<li>optional - ITAL
  100 ( 4:30 to 6:30 at Surrey, MW) - <strong> Intro To Italian </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h5>
  Bin #2 : The \"Tuesday Thursday\" </h5>\n<ul class=\"classes\">\n<li>CMPT 401 (9:30-11:20,
  Tuesday, 10:30-11:20 Thursday) - <strong>Operating Systems II </strong></li>\n<li>CMPT
  886 (12:30-2:30, Tuesday, 1:30 - 2:30 Tuesday) - <strong> Special Topics In Operating
  Systems (Multi-core OS) </strong></li>\n<li>ITAL 100 (2:30-4:20, Tuesday-Friday)
  - <strong>Intro To Italian</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\nNow, that second set looks way
  more interesting.. operating systems all the way down! On the other hand, 401 is
  a difficult, project-based 400-level OS course, and 886 is a difficult, research-based
  graduate-level course. I don't know if I'm smart enough to handle it! \n\nThe first
  set? Meh.  It's okay.  Nothing to write home about. Just another semester. Plod
  plod. \n\nOh, and the Italian? Well, I want to learn some Italian. And there really
  weren't any more good courses on those days anyways.\n(I'm actually pretty disappointed
  that this is the best the CS department can provide for a Spring semester. Boo!
  ) - As a bonus, it'll keep me from going on Academic Probation if I happen to fail
  401 and 886 simultaneously.\n"
