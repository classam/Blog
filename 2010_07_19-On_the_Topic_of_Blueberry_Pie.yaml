  afternoon, the internet. I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of pies, am about to
  produce a blueberry pie.\n\nOh yes.  Oh, yes.  The fresh blueberry pie is one of
  mankind's finest pies, for the simple reason that it is the easiest pie in the entire
  universe to make. Let's do a quick overview of the pie assembly requirements.\n\n<h3>1.
  \ Blueberries.</h3>\nWe're gonna need lots of 'em.  Enough to fill at least one
  pie crust.  Remember, there's nothing sadder than an understuffed blueberry pie,
  so we must ensure that the blueberry count is high.  Unused blueberries will always
  find a home.\n\nBy home, I mean <em>I will unrepentantly stuff these blueberries
  into my mouth with both hands.</em>\n\nNow the important part - <strong>wash these
  blueberries</strong>. Wash 'em good. Nobody likes a mouth full of stem.\n\n<h3>2.
  Supplies.</h3>\n<em>Minions!</em> Fetch me a <strong>Tenderflake pre-made pie crust</strong>,
  a package of <strong>blueberry-flavoured pie-glaze</strong>, and a <strong>fork</strong>.
  \ Admittedly, this is not as classy as hand-rolling a fine pie dough, nor making
  glaze from scratch, but doing either of these things can turn a <em>15 minute pie</em>
  into a <em>day long pie project</em>.  We need to make a pie immediately between
  coming home from work and going out to the pub with friends. We need a pie that
  can be made very, very quickly.  We need a pie that can <em>take the heat</em> and
  <em>stand up to the forces of evil.</em>\n\n<h3>3. Procure poker to produce perforations
  in pie paddin'.</h3>\n<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; USE fork ON pie crust </code> \n\n<code>I'M
  SORRY, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND pie crust </code>\n\n<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; USE fork ON crust
  </code> \n\n<code>THE crust IS NOW A perforated crust ! </code>\n\n<h3>4. Bake </h3>\nNow
  it is time, time to place the pie crust in the oven at HEAT degrees for TIME minutes.
  (Both HEAT and TIME can be found on your TenderFlake box. It's like 400 degrees
  for 10 minutes or something. Not long, not long.) \n\nSeriously, you should have
  been preheating your oven from Step 1. back there. Did I not mention that? I am
  such a jerk.  Have you learned your lesson about not reading the entire recipe before
  attempting to prepare it?  I bet you have. \n\nAnd while your pie crust is baking,
  you get no rest, because it's time to prepare the \n\n<h3>5. GLAZE.</h3>\nOh yes.
  Mix an embarrassing amount of sugar in with the pie glaze mix.  Read the package,
  it's enough sugar to give you and everybody in your family <em>instant mega-diabetes.</em>
  \ Whisk it. Whisk it good.  Whisk it. Whisk it real good.  Do this in a bowl.  Without
  the bowl, you will have a staggering mess on your hands.    Then pour some hot water
  on that bad boy, while still mixing. It's going to start turning purply and gooey.
  \ Pay no attention to your desire to eat hot glaze out of the bowl. This road leads
  only to madness.  Instead, <strong>pour in the blueberries.</strong> Mix it up and
  what you have is pie-ready hot glazed blueberries. Good times.\n\nThis step should
  take exactly as long as the pie crust.  Remove the baked pie crust from the oven.
  \ In order to cool off the oven faster, place a live squirrel inside.   \n\n<h3>6.
  Enterprise Integration</h3>\n<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;PUT glazed blueberries IN baked pie
  crust </code>\n\n<code>THE glazed blueberries AND baked pie crust ARE NOW blueberry
  pie. </code>\n\n<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;PUT blueberry pie IN fridge </code>\n\n<code>THE
  blueberry pie IS NOW IN THE fridge </code>\n\n<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;GO NORTH </code>\n\n<code>YOU
  ARE NOW AT THE pub. </code>\n\n<h3>7. Wait for one hour. </h3>\n\nThat glaze needs
  to set up. Nobody likes a fallin' apart pie.  Spend this time drinking, and/or acquiring
  whipped cream.  If at all possible, try to drink while acquiring whipped cream. "
