content: ! "So, today, I discovered that Ryan Estrada is up to Hijinx. \n\nOne of
  my regular-rotation webcomics had a guest comic by Ryan Estrada.  No big deal, usually-
  guest comics are as common on the internet as... uh... other things. \n\nBut then,
  as I was wandering aimlessly through my list of 'less-often-read' webcomics, the
  name \"Ryan Estrada\" appeared a few more times- each one with a guest comic. \n\nI
  started going through my list of comics and checking to see which ones had been
  \"Estrada'd\".\n\nSam & Fuzzy, Shortpacked, Wapsi Square, Real Life, Scary-Go-Round,
  Dresden Codak, Anders Loves Maria, and We The Robots - and those are just the comics
  that I know about.  \n\nHow far does the rabbit hole go?  I'll have to do some investigative
  journalism.\n\nAnd add <a href=\"http://www.ryanestrada.com\">ryanestrada.com</a>
  to my list of 'comics to read.'"
