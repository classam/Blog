  Days later, I&#39;ve recovered, but I still feel like shit.

  I haven&#39;t eaten much in the last few days, and apparently I burst a few blood
  vessels in my eyes.. that is the ugliest thing I&#39;ve seen in awhile.&nbsp; Of
  course, I can&#39;t bear to look at my own eyes, now, because I.. get extroardinarily
  touchy about the subject of eyes. (touching my eyes, damaged eyes, anything like
  that, thinking about it gives me the willies)


  Well, much to do! I&#39;m late! &nbsp;'
