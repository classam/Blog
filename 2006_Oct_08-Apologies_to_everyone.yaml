  Well, in terms of interesting projects I''m working on lately, Dylan Innes has prevailed
  upon me to build a website at www.sfuca.com for his upcoming club-for-SFU-cartoonists,
  the "SFU Cartoonist''s Alliance". Currently, the site is hosted at <a href="http://sfuca.pfak.org/phpBB2/"
  title="SFUCA!">sfuca.pfak.org</a> until Dylan purchases a domain name for us.


  (But wait, that''s just a bare phpBB forum!)   Hey! I''ll put more up! .. eventually.
