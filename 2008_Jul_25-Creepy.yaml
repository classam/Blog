content: ! "So, there's a guy in a cubicle right next to mine whose name is \"Steve
  Watson\", and who acts a lot like the Steve Watson that I knew. \n\nI'd tell him,
  but there's no non-creepy way to say \"You look and act just like my recently-dead
  uncle, and also you have the same name as him.  I bet you're about the same age,
  too. Strange, huh? \" "
