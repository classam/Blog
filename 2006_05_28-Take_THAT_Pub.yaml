  I really should take more shots at Chartwells. The Pub sucks, but at least it isn&#39;t
  infused with that malevolent sense of *EVIL* that Chartwells has. You know, Whistler
  prices, Gulag atmosphere, customer service from the fifth circle of hell (&quot;The
  Wrathful And Sullen&quot;)

  .... But the Pub just started closing at 7:00 each night and closing permanently
  during test-takin&#39; times. That&#39;s when we need alcohol the most!
