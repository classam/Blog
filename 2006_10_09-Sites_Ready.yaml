content: ! 'Well, the site''s not really ready.  Dylan must get his hands on the www.sfuca.com
  domain. But the bsaic site (read: phpBB2 forum) is up at <a href="http://sfuca.pfak.org">sfuca.pfak.org</a>


  On a side note, wow, phpBB2 is so easy to install/use/etc..

  Not like MoinMoin (which is a wiki that I installed earlier, and it turns out that
  it''s a total bitch to install and work with.)'
