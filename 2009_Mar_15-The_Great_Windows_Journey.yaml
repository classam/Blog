content: ! "I've devoted most of today to Windows Update Time. \n\nA client of mine
  asked me to do a project for him in ASP.NET instead of PHP.  I explained to him
  that - while PHP is not necessarily the best language in the world, with the size
  of the project, ASP.NET would introduce a lot more <u>slow</u> into the development
  time of the project.  On top of that- while I've spent time working with both PHP
  and ASP.NET, I'm quite a bit faster working with one than the other.\n\nHe dismissed
  it off-hand - \"I shouldn't have to pay for training time!\".  (Of course, he put
  it much more nicely than that, but that's the gist of it.) \n\nSigh.  Okay, so,
  immediately, I get hit by a bad case of the <u>Microsoft Slow</u> as I have to turn
  my trusty Serious Business Development Mac, as well as my Vista Gaming Beast, both
  into bona-fide Windows Development Machines.\n\nNote for those keeping score at
  home, the Serious Business Development Mac is my trusty sidekick. She follows me
  wherever I go.  The day I find a way to waterproof her is the day I have her running
  in the shower with me.  Currently, she runs Mac OS X as a primary OS, with Ubuntu
  Server and XP Pro running in virtual machines. (The XP virtual machine is bootable,
  too, which is a nice but rarely-used feature.) \n\nThe Vista Gaming Beast is a monster-
  a quad-core with the most expensive graphics card I could afford ($65, a just-barely-functional
  Radeon HD 2400 with serious system stability problems) - double 22-inch monitors,
  and all the Adobe CreativeSuite that it can handle.   \n\nSo, turning these into
  Windows Development Machines.  This means (essentially), IIS, SQL Server and Visual
  Studio, as well as SVN and probably a Visual-Studio-SVN integration package. Even
  for one-week jobs, source control is stage one! \n\nNow, first of all, I look into
  Windows Server- maybe a nice cheap development license that I can run under a Virtual
  Machine. If I'm lucky, it'll be covered under my MSDNAA account at SFU.\n\nNope
  and nope.  For the absolute lowest-end-of-the-lowest-end Windows Server licenses,
  I'm going to run into a <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/pricing.aspx\">$500-USD
  charge</a>.  Oh, maybe if I start running a more professional shop I'll shell out
  the cash and set up a personal Windows Development Server, then pass the cost on
  to clients in a formal \"Why the heck would you want to use Windows\" surcharge-
  but for now, that option's out. \n\nOkay, that leaves me with Vista (on my Vista
  Gaming Beast) and XP Pro (on my Serious Business Development Mac).  \n\nNow I run
  into the Latest Tools problem.  Vista comes with IIS 6- the current most-recent
  version is IIS 7. Now, if I were using Ubuntu, the solution would be clearly apparent-
  <em> upgrade to the newest version of the server, you putz! </em>.  No, no, unfortunately,
  Microsoft reserves the newest software for those privileged users who have shelled
  out the money for Windows Server Edition 2008.\n\nOkay, so now we've installed IIS6,
  a grand testament to the fact that Microsoft views developers as cash cows ripe
  for the milking, it's time to check on Visual Studio 2005.  Fortunately, I had VS2005
  installed earlier, to fiddle with Source modding. ( I was curious as to what making
  a Valve Source-Mod would entail.  The answer: Frustration and horror. ) - So, that
  was a freebie, thanks to the fact that I had the foresight to install it with all
  of the options.\n\nNot Visual Studio 2008, mind you- Visual Studio 2005.  Keeping
  in mind that, forgetting Ballmer's speech, Microsoft hates developers, developers,
  developers, Visual Studio 2008 comes in varieties from Standard to Super-Duper-Premium-Team-Pro-Ultimate,
  with costs ranging from $300 to $6000.  VS 2005 comes with MSDNAA, at least. \n\nOkay,
  so now we're on to installing SQL Server 2005.  Yes, that's 2005, again. By now
  you've heard the rant- but in this case, Microsoft made the downright sensible decision
  of pricing their Developer edition at only $50! (I may even buy it, if push comes
  to shove!) - of course, the poor IT team wanting to use SQL Server 2005 is going
  to have to shell out upwards of $25,000 to get up and running. At least it's not
  Oracle, eh? \n\nFor those of you keeping track at home, a good Windows Development
  Rig will run you a minimum of $900, and that's if you're going sparse on the features.\n\nAt
  this point, I'm starting to miss the Good Ole Days of working in a company where
  the software just appears on my computer, pre-configured and paid for.\n\nSQL Server,
  however, didn't install cleanly.  Why? After a couple of hours of investigation,
  I discovered that it was because Visual Studio (back when I had installed it) had
  installed SQL Server Express, and the SQL Server Express management tools were conflicting
  with the SQL Server management tools.  Glory be. Having solved that problem, the
  Vista Development Server was up and running! Huzzah!  With SVN already installed,
  I was golden. Estimated time, 5 hours.  \n\nUnfortunately, I spend my weekends roaming
  the hills of North Vancouver.  My Late-Friday/Saturday project became turning my
  Mac's XP instance into a development server, too.  \n\nNow, despite all of the Vista
  bashing, like unto XP before it, Vista has matured into a stable and usable operating
  system over the past little while.  All Windows 7 really needs to do is change the
  name and I bet people will be fine upgrading, now that it's a little bit less likely
  to cause a massive system failure.  I'm not a fan of the multi-tiered-operating-system
  Media-Business-Ultimate-Cool-Ranch-Kenny-Loggins model, but hey, I've got Vista
  Business, I can do Important Things with the computer. Slices through a tomato,
  no problem. \n\nXP Pro, on the other hand, is starting to show it's age.  We start
  with Windows Update- now a habit when I boot up the Windows side of my Mac computer-
  if anything, because I use Windows <em>so</em> infrequently on my Mac that whenever
  I start XP up, they've released 5 new security updates and a new browser or something.\n\nThis
  time, it was SP3- the long awaited service pack containing security updates, patches,
  drivers, and a few choice backports from Vista.  Okay, all right, that'll be step
  one.\n\nMany megabytes of downloading and slow installation later, it was time to
  install IIS.  Okay, so, the version of IIS that comes with XP Pro- called \"XP Pro\"
  because it's the <em>more expensive</em> version of XP, the one for developers and
  guys with Serious Business Ties- is IIS 5.1, fully two versions behind the current
  Most Popular Version. \n\nJoy upon joys.  Ah, well, I worked with IIS 5.1 at Electronic
  Arts, I can work on it at home. \n\nA brief check on the internet. \"Can XP Pro
  be upgraded to IIS 6?\"\n\nAn even briefer answer. \"No.\"\n\nIt was time to get
  started with SQL Server- in order to avoid the SQL Express / SQL Server snafu that
  I had experienced on the Vista computer, I was starting with the database this time
  around.  \n\n... and the installation failed.  A brief check on the internet explained
  that SQL Server doesn't play well with XP SP3. Way to keep core business products
  compatible, Microsoft.  Apparently, XP SP3 has a newer copy of the MSXML library
  than SQL Server does- and when SQL Server tries to overwrite the library, it fails.
  \ The bug is listed by Microsoft as a Wontfix, because apparently, SQL Server <u>should</u>
  continue the installation using the new library instead of the old.  It, however,
  doesn't.  \n\nEasy solution- either uninstall-and-reinstall SP3 (a multi-hour process),
  or remove the MSXML library.  Okay, removing the MSXML library sounds like it's
  going to be faster- let's just open Add/Remove Files and get the bugger gone.  Take
  THAT, foul library!\n\nTake that?  No, the MSXML library refuses to uninstall itself.
  \ Oh, new feature of SP3- protected libraries can't be uninstalled.  Don't know
  why they're even listed in the Add/Remove Files window!\n\nOkay, so now we spend
  hours perusing the internet, trying to find better removal instructions.  Eventually,
  I come across a little-known Microsoft utility known as the Windows Install Clean-Up
  utility.  Apparently, it was designed to deal with installers that crash in mid-process,
  leaving half-installed, un-uninstallable, corrupted programs just lounging around
  the computer.  Fortuitously enough, it also acts quite handily as a \"OUT! OUT VILE
  PROGRAM!\" utility for programs that just don't want to exorcise themselves. \n\nProblem
  solved! Well, after a while, that is.\n\nOkay, now we have the installation of Visual
  Studio 2005, MSDN, a .NET runtime for ASP.NET 2.0/3.5, any number of small ASP.NET
  tools ( http://asp.net provides a one-shot installer with a lot of ASP.NET goodies
  all in one package. ) \n\nAfter that, well, what the heck, while I've got update
  fever, it was time to upgrade the Virtual Machine software.  VMWare Fusion has upgraded
  a full major version since I installed it, and it's been nagging me for months.
  \ Fortunately, this part of the process was the only thing that went nice n' easy.
  \ It wasn't automatic, mind you, but with a few well-explained steps I had upgraded
  my Virtual Machine software and all of my Virtual Machines. \n\nAnd, finally, now
  it's time to run Windows Update and get all of those tools up to their most recent
  versions.  This is a multi-hour process that takes it's sweet, sweet time.  Go,
  Windows Update, go! Okay, ample opportunity to get dinner.  Those of you who administer
  Windows computers know exactly how sluggish Windows Update can be.  Getting XP from
  factory-install to fully-updated-SP3 takes as long as University- and adding a bunch
  of Microsoft software doesn't help any.\n\nAnd now we're finally done- except the
  Visual Studio SP1 upgrade failed.  Worst of all, it failed silently.  I ran Windows
  Update again, consigning myself to another hour-long process of very, very slow
  installation, to see if I could catch the problem.  Okay, an obscure error code!
  \ A brief search on the error code revealed that in order to get the Visual Studio
  SP1 upgrade working in XP SP3, I'd need to find some obscure management tool in
  Windows and allow Windows Update to have fuller access to the system so long as
  it's being run by an administrator. ( o_O ). Having finished that, I consigned myself
  to, once again, go through the long and arduous Windows Upgrade process.\n\nOh,
  it failed again. Joy upon joys!  Checking the internet once again for some voodoo
  solution to this obscure error code (0x643), I find that, while the Visual Studio
  SP1 update only takes 455 megabytes of space, it will fail without a full 3 gigabytes
  of space to decompress in. \n\nNow, I've only devoted 20 gigs to my poor little
  Windows partition, and it's already crammed to the gills with the huge Visual Studio,
  SQL Server, and MSDN.  Leaving just 2 free gigabytes, and the small set of Steam
  games that will run on my Mac's weak old graphics chip.\n\nGoodbye, World of Goo!
  Goodbye, The Ship!  Goodbye, Penny Arcade Adventures! You're going to have to go,
  to make room for Visual Studio to update itself. \n\n-sigh, it's now 1:00 in the
  morning, and I'm nowhere near finished. - (<strong>Edit:</strong> Finished around
  three. )\n\nNow, the full amount of time this has taken me is somewhere around 15-16
  hours for the two computers, all un-billable time. \n\nYes, in the future, I'm going
  to have to find a way to code the price of working with Windows technology in my
  estimates.  \n"
