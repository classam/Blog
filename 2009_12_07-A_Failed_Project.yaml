content: ! "Sometimes when I'm in the car with Kristen, she'll switch from my iPod
  to the FOX radio station.  This fills me with deep anger - all of a sudden my Cake,
  or Ladytron, or Flight of the Conchords, or Flobots, or Feist, or Kaizers Orchestra,
  or whatever ... is replaced, by a sudden and vile outporing of crass commercialism
  and mainstream music.\n\nSo, I began a project.  A project to download all of the
  music played in a week on FOX, create a separate channel on my iPod that Kristen
  could switch to.  At least there wouldn't be any commercials. I figured - how hard
  can it be? They just play the same songs over and over again, anyways.  So, I did
  the nerdy thing and started collecting raw data from their website, then piping
  it through programs for purposes of analysis and moustachery.  <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/projects/cfox/\">Data
  here</a>.  There's a histogram, one which can be used to show that a certain set
  of songs saw a very large percentage of airtime.  \n\nI even made an infographic,
  just to demonstrate that my color sense is so broken as to be completely beyond
  repair. \n\n<img src=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/comics/radio.gif\" alt=\"Info! Graphic!\"
  />\n\nAnd then, I started on the difficult project of trolling the web to find all
  of this music. \n\nThe project made it to about \"C\" before I was unable to go
  any further. The reason? In order to keep all of this new music manageable, I was
  loading it into my iTunes library.  Lacking a canonical playlist of favourites,
  I spend a lot of time just shuffling around the iTunes main library, and I was finding
  that my new acquisitions were starting to pollute my earspace.  On top of that,
  my iPod pulls a small, random selection of music that I haven't listened to... let's
  just say that my library was getting polluted with music that I didn't want to listen
  to. \n\nI don't want to seem like a music snob - I mean, heck, I harbor an irrational
  love of Kylie Minogue and hyper-peppy-Scandinavian-pop a-la Aqua. That alone forever
  bars me from hipsterdom.  But some of the music on FOX just doesn't do it for me.
  \n\nWhich leads me to the song that really sealed the deal for me.  Buckcherry's
  \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKX8v46Z11E\">Crazy Bitch</a>\".  Having
  the _live_ version of this song come up in my playlist, at all, prevented me from
  proceeding any further in my project.\n\nI feel bad for hating an otherwise-<a title=\"CATCHY!\"
  href=\"http://www.shutupwomangetonmyhorse.com/\">catchy</a> song for having stunningly
  vapid lyrics - I mean, hey, once again, Aqua.  Can't help it, though.\n\nWell, ultimately
  the project failed.  As a bonus, though, I don't have to deal with any more FOX
  tunes in my library, so I suppose that ultimately the project was a success at convincing
  me to further ignore the radio. \n"
