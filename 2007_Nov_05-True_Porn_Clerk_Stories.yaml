content: ! "When I was browsing my \"Bookmarks\" folder, I found one of my favourite
  bits of reading, the \"<a href=\"http://www.improvresourcecenter.com/mb/tpcs1.php\">True
  Porn Clerk Stories</a>\". As per the name, it's the journal of a clerk at an anonymous
  movie store with a larger-than-average porn collection (the movie store, not the
  clerk), and her assorted musings vis-a-vis the irritating customers.\n\nIt's frequently
  insightful, and often hilarious.  Sometimes both: \n\n<blockquote style=\"padding:
  5px 10px 5px 10px;\">\nI don't think it's that women are less sexual than men. I
  think they could or would like porn if the situation were different. There are still
  fairly big taboos about women admitting to being interested in porn - even for the
  ones who rent pretty racy stuff from upstairs. And the movies would have to be different.
  There'd have to be more about why these people are having sex. A better reason than
  Tab A fitting into Slot B, at least.\n\nAnd, from what I do know about porn, the
  sex would have to be different. It doesn't look like the women on porn boxes are
  having that much fun. They're always being bent or twisted into uncomfortable positions,
  or trying to avoid sperm being shot directly into their eyes. The fact that the
  men watching want to see as much as possible means that the women don't seem to
  be getting touched much. They're just getting poled by some guy who's apparently
  deliberately avoiding their erogenous zones. Whee.\n\nSo we don't get many women
  downstairs.\n</blockquote>\n\nThat sarcastic 'Whee' makes me laugh every time. Heh
  heh. Whee! "
