  here.


  First of all, from the Carlito Carlito Carlito album I posted a link to before,
  Diamonds and Business, (I''m scared of the future. Why are you scared of the future,
  Bolton? Because it''s scary. That makes sense- let''s sing about it!)  and the 1*2*3
  album.. (Silver Bells especially, it''s such a terrible song.)


  On top of that, though, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZCNrf0IH_U">George
  Washington</a> (YouTube) song. He saves the children, but not the British children!'
