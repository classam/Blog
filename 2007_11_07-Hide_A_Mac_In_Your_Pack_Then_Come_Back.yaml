  Apple Macbook, U.S.: $1099 .. or,  $989 CAD.


  The only problem with plundering the United States for phat lewt is that Canadian
  Customs is on the way, making things difficult... and the Customs guidelines are

  (I suspect looting the United States for books and electronics would be easier with
  Kristen & her American mom, with her American passport. We''re ever so un-suspicious.  Just
  travellin'' through to mail some packages and buy some delicious dairy products!) '
