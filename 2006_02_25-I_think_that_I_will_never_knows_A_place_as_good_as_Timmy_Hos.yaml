  A sad story, this. The features editor at <a href="http://lassam.wordpress.com/wp-admin/www.peak.sfu.ca">The
  Peak</a>, Debbie, asked me to do an illustration for a "Last Word" article that
  she was running. The kick? I was allowed to use colour and everything! I may have
  gone a little nuts... It was my first real experience with colour that didn''t look
  like total ass, and it took me most of a day to complete. All of the colours are
  flat and very ''animationy'', and the emotional effect is completely dulled by the
  complete spectrum of pastel colours. Let me tell you, the front counter all by itself
  is pretty.. well.. depressing.

  The technique of using an almost monochromic set of colours on each layer makes
  for a much more eye-grabbing picture than one would expect. I didn''t think of any
  real emotional bent, to the article, so I went for a neutral with this one- If I
  was going for a more piss-&amp;-moan "I''m so very cool" coffee-shop look, I would
  have done the whole thing in purples and blues, like the front counter.


  Well, I produced something that''s at least interesting, if a little bit too ''way
  overcrowded'' and a little bit too ''nickelodean''. So, then, the article that it
  was to accompany, a sordid piece of crap about how white guys never pay the bill
  at Tim Hortons, never ran. I''m kinda glad that the article didn''t run, because
  it really sucked, but now the picture has no home. Except here, where I can pretend
  I''m an artiste'', just because I drew a picture with some colour.'
