  articles feature jokes that are only funny for complete and utter nerds.</em>\n\nSo,
  I downloaded <a href=\"http://www.yisongyue.com/shaney/\">Mark V. Shaney</a>, debugged
  him a little to get him working under Python 2.6, and set him loose to analyzing
  40 pages of my blog posts.  Afterwards, he produced this: \n\n<ul>\n<li> And now
  I’m free, free as a big pile of ugly. </li>\n<li> Ah, that old biblical standby-
  you suck, you’re horrible, but even then they’re slippery slopes. </li>\n<li> There
  are a number of different ‘types’ of HTTP Request, you get something good anyways.
  </li>\n<li> The Olive Garden is a Fuddy Duddy can then conclude that a Universe
  simulation would have explained this to work, posts need eye-catching, descriptive
  titles, and you can add margins, which add space around the edges. </li>\n<li> I
  have a lot of these people, they are in the Applied Science building. </li>\n<li>
  His wholesomeness is driven home with Sepand and Ryan were getting a temp badge,
  I met my team for the whole seat but you’ll be scraping, then iterate through it
  by calling it “Italian” food- it’s really more “Italian-themed” food, like Canadianized
  Chinese food or the Hypertext Transport Protocol, is the equivalent of having the
  entire Helium community is too weak and liquidy, cook it longer.\n</li>\n<li> That’s
  not right. </li>\n<li> Start with vegetables. </li>\n<li> Okay, enough with the
  values of all else. </li>\n<li> You can’t throttle or cap your downloads (So when
  it comes down to it, Systems Hungarian has some uses— but in the scene, let’s concentrate
  on the internet. </li>\n<li> It has tight memory management, so it’s not bad.</li>\n<li>
  While I understand that the best platformer for the enemies to engage in a WalMart,
  or at least, people that you’re describing, while you’re describing it. </li>\n<li>
  Sometimes, you just run sudo apt-get install openssh-client. </li>\n<li> As something
  that appeared on one of those questions answered- (Hoping being the operative word)-
  but instead I’m getting drilled in the mobile world, they’re integrating a host
  of tools that work with assorted web technomologies, the three of us. </li>\n<li>
  With ‘gpg’, you can only be used within the command line, however, you can dance,
  you can toss a lid on top of that. </li>\n<li> Enough of that, the restaurant is
  going to be free, and often very powerful. </li>\n<li> Spaceball. </li>\n<li> I
  suspect that my credit-card number have no card at all! What a waste! I won’t even
  mention the rash of nicknames currently spreading across America. </li>\n<li> Python
  is automatically part of the industry, takes years, and thanks to the bus on the
  internet of the stylesheets and javascript elements loaded on a project, I like
  that are acronyms. </li>\n<li> The Type B will invoke the potential specter of the
  first time in the crowd wish for a first-year Comp Sci student, but I’m a big chunk
  of stem in your HTML, and if I have to be pretty incriminating if people aren’t
  already doing this with the system. </li>\n<li> (Shut up.) Finally, I’m a sharp
  guy- I have to stay up late, this is good for clear images without a clean installation
  of an earth-shaking sandwich. </li>\n<li> Now, I’ll say this right now- we’ve got
  some Corel products and some sort of behind-the-scenes ‘this is beyond what you
  get, take-it-or-leave-it, and nothing more. </li>\n<li> The Library is surprisingly
  tiny and has no real justification.</li>\n<li> Given that, the consequences are
  rarely more than a blank slate. </li>\n</ul>\n\nNice."
