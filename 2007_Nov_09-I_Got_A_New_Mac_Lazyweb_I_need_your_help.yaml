  a <a title=\"This is not my new Powerbook, but mine isn't in much better condition.\"

  Powerbook</a> ( 500Mhz, 256Mb RAM, 20Gb HDD ) in a game of chance involving a stack
  of elephants and 27 pennies, and now I need to make it into a beast of burden to
  call my own. \n\nDespite the fact that I have a much better laptop. \n\nThat's not
  held together largely by tape and dreams. \n\nOne that doesn't need a replacement
  power-supply. \n\nIt has Mac Os X running on it, but I can't actually *use* it because
  the whole thing is locked down with user names and passwords.  Plus, wouldn't Mac
  Os X be slow on such an old machine?  I'd like to give the X a try, but I don't
  know how to break in and start fiddling without a clean install- and I don't have
  the resources for a clean installation of an old version of Mac Os X. (I'm sure
  NEWER versions will break the hell out of it.)\n\nI've decided that the best course
  of action will be to install Xubuntu on it and see how that runs.  Ubuntu is a pretty
  heavyweight beast, though- I might end up experimenting with some other alternatives
  for Mac Reanimation.. like Slackware.\n\nSo.. do any of you know a way to acquire
  old Mac OS X softwares?  Or a way to tell the Mac \"I am not one of these people,
  they are all gone, please make me the new Root\"? \n\nOr, failing that, what would
  you be running on the ol' box?"
