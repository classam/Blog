  lot of times, I make a snap judgement on a course (\"This is going to be frustrating
  and horrible, I know it!\"), but I don't drop the course immediately (\"It could
  get better, right?\").  This is, of course, a huge mistake on my part.  Honestly,
  a lot of times I just don't want to be left hanging in some sort of Twilight Zone
  where I've dropped one course and there's nothing there to replace it. \n\nThe Animation
  course offered by SIAT at SFU is one of those gems.  It's two parts, a two-hour-lecture
  and a two-hour-lab.\n\nThe two-hour lecture is not two solid hours of information
  transmission.  The professor has a <em>thick</em> accent, and his grasp on the English
  language is ... adequate.  On top of that, he's new to the whole 'professoring'
  business, and so not only does he use Powerpoint, his slides are the common trope
  of \"Here are a bunch of pictures, I'm going to talk a bit about this thing\".  The
  topics meander, there is no easy way to summarize what he's saying or separate important/relevant
  data from 'chaff', and just listening at all is an exercise in frustration. \n\nThe
  two-hour lab is (quite possibly) worse-  the professor blazes through a process
  on a demo computer. *woosh woosh woosh woosh*- and here we have a balloon-puppy!
  \ Of course, being as no human being is able to precisely follow steps at the same
  speed as the professor goes, people inevitably get lost.  Some people sit, staring
  at the computer and the professor like sad, lost puppies.  Others (here we have
  me) inevitably grab the tutorial slides and try to make our way through the tutorial
  at our own (more appropriate) pace.  \n\nWhich would be good, were it not for the
  professor's aforementioned nebulous control of the English language.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/images/lazywork.jpg\"
  alt=\"An example of a tutorial slide.\" />\n\nNot only does this tutorial have roughly
  the same level of clarity as your standard table-assembly-instructions (\"Insert
  left leg ('A') into right peg ('B') also twisting table-top('C') lengthwise\"),
  it's painfully short, omits important instructions, contains precious few images
  of associated steps, and contains no context information. \n\nAnd let's not even
  start with the professor's exaggerated time-frame for the tutorials.  In week one,
  having spent exactly 0 (zero) minutes using the software, the tutorial quite optimistically
  assumed that we would be able to learn our way around the user-interface, assemble
  a fine beer mug, followed by an entire Indiana-Jones-inspired cave-and-bridge scene,
  in about 2 hours.  \n\nNobody completed these tasks, of course.  After about an
  hour-of-a-half most of us had reasonable mugs going on- but that was after the TA
  had gone to just about each and every computer and painstakingly explained the process
  to each individual student.\n\nThat second scene found it's way into the second
  tutorial, with the following itinerary: \n<ul>\n<li>Exercise 1: Surface Bevel &
  Planar (15 minutes)</li>\n<li>Exercise 2: Polygon Duplicate & Color (10 minutes)</li>\n<li>Exercise
  3: Set Design</li>\n<li>–Castle: Polygon Extrude & Polygon Boolean (15 minute)</li>\n<li>–Terrain
  : Sculpt Geometry & Polygon Split (15 minute)</li>\n<li>–Bridge: Duplicate (15 minute)</li>\n</ul>\n\n*sigh*.\n\nSo,
  I've spent the last few weeks painstakingly trying to assemble enough Maya knowledge
  to actually construct something useful and reasonable (see: not something directly
  out of a tutorial) out of various online references and textbooks- although not
  the textbooks that we had to buy for the course, which have been (so far) pretty
  narrow in scope at best. \n\nI hate this. "
