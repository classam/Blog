content: ! "<em>\"<a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?cat=24\">Design & Typography</a>\"
  articles cover a topic near and dear to my heart: Making things look pretty. </em>\n\nI
  have been using the fabulous Adobe Caslon Pro font, recently.  I am just overwhelmed
  with how pretty Adobe Caslon Pro is.  It makes me sad that, as a web designer, I
  never really get to work with fonts that pure and beautiful without having to compromise
  the <em>other</em> sort of purity offered by the web &mdash; good ol' fashioned
  plaintext. \n\nIf you're interested in typography, I found some new (well, new to
  me, at least) blogs that you might like.  The first is called <a href=\"http://ilovetypography.com\">I
  Love Typography</a>, and if you're interested in the world of general fontiness,
  the site delivers, in spades.  A slightly more professional feeling publication,
  <a href=\"http://ilovetypography.com\">Typographica</a> seems also to steep in the
  world of professional typography. \n\nIt almost makes me want to... I don't know.
  Something fonty. "
