  articles expound endlessly on a variety of topics completely and utterly ridiculous.</em>\n\nGood
  afternoon, the internet. I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of consumables, have
  discovered the most magical of man foods. \n\nThe dumpling, the wonton, the potsticker,
  the meaty-doughball, the meaty-meaty-surprise, the Ontario Mudflap; it goes by many
  names, but all of these names mean the same thing. Meat wrapped in pastry.  Except
  for 'Ontario Mudflap'. I'm pretty sure I shouldn't talk about what that means in
  polite conversation. \n\nThe stately potsticker meets all of the requirements for
  a good \"man food\". \n\n<h3>1. Versatile</h3>\nA potsticker can be fried, boiled,
  steamed, deep fried, or served in soup.  \n\n<h3>2. Easy</h3>\nBoiling, frying,
  deep frying, or serving-in-soup are all very easy to do.  Seriously, most of them
  just involve a three step process. \n\n<ol>\n<li> Get something hot. </li>\n<li>
  Drop in the dumplings. </li>\n<li> Wait until they're cooked. </li>\n</ol>\n\nAdmittedly,
  if you're going to fry them in a pan, it'd probably be best to toss some chicken
  broth in there for many juicy flavors. Or not.  Your call. \n\n<h3>3. Portable</h3>\nWant
  some food on the run? Just slide a cooked dumpling or three in your pocket <em>for
  the road.</em> \n\n<h3>4. Terrible For You</h3>\nSalty, fatty pork in a pastry shell.
  \ Nice. \n\nOh, and they go great with <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=1403\">Chili
  Oil</a>. So that's a plus, too. "
