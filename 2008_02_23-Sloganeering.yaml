  sure if we were allowed to plagiarize, because there's a couple of quotes that I'd
  love to have on a T-shirt:\n\n<blockquote>\nIt should be noted that no ethically-trained
  software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad procedure. Basic
  professional ethics would instead require him to write a DestroyCity procedure,
  to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter. (Nathaniel S Borenstein) </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nShould
  array indices start at 0 or 1? My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought,
  proper consideration. (Stan Kelly-Bootle)</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nYou can
  either have software quality or you can have pointer arithmetic, but you cannot
  have both at the same time. (Bertrand Meyer)</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nThou
  shalt not follow the NULL pointer, for chaos and madness await thee at its end.
  (Henry Spencer) \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nWhy bother with subroutines when
  you can type fast? (Vaughn Rokosz)\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nA Netscape engineer
  who shan't be named once passed a pointer to JavaScript, stored it as a string and
  later passed it back to C, killing 30. (Blake Ross)\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe
  three chief virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Impatience and Hubris. (Larry
  Wall)\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nâ€¦one of the main causes of the fall of the
  Roman Empire was that, lacking zero, they had no way to indicate successful termination
  of their C programs. (Robert Firth)\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe C Programming
  Language - A language which combines the flexibility of assembly language with the
  power of assembly language. (Anonymous)\n</blockquote>\n\nAnd, because some of those
  might be too long or too illegal to put on a T-shirt, I contributed some bite-size
  slogans of my own:\n\n<ul>\n<li> Computing Science: It's not like you were going
  to get laid anyways. </li>\n<li> Computing Science: There's no business like no
  business. </li>\n<li> Computing Science: The beardedest discipline of them all.
  </li>\n<li> Computing Science: sudo apt-get install awesome </li>\n<li> Computing
  Science: Carpal tunnel has never been so fun! </li>\n<li> Computing Science: You're
  doing it too slow, move over, let me try! </li>\n<li> Computing Science: Statistically
  25% less likely to end in tears than Philosophy. </li>\n<li> Computing Science:
  The fifth best department at SFU! </li>\n<li> Computing Science: We're number 0!
  </li>\n<li> The highest form of humour is the non-sequitur. (on the back) CORN RUUUUSH!
  </li>\n<li> <code> if ( 2b || !2b ) { the_question = that; } </code></li>\n<li>
  Computing Science: Long int is looooong. </li>\n<li> So, I heer u liek mudkipz.
  </li>\n<li> Computing Science is not a meme. </li>\n<li> I am recursively defined
  as myself + 1 </li>\n<li> 12/0 = Computing Science </li>\n<li> Computing Science:
  Proudly putting words on t-shirts since 1983! </li>\n<li> Computing Science: Are
  you familiar with the concept of a Texas Teabag?  No? Good, then this'll be a surprise.
  </li>\n<li> Computing Science: SERIOUS BUSINESS </li>\n<li> Computing Science: !Engineering
  </li>\n<li> Computing Science: Sleep considered harmful. </li>\n</ul>"
