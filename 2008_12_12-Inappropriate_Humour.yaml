content: ! "Throughout my life, I've used bad humour to punctuate just about anything
  that I do.  I'm not exactly Mitch Hedberg (or even Carlos Mencia - ugh), but I'm
  just witty enough to get a hit every couple of tries.\n\nNot just that, I do it
  all the time.  During class, during finals, in Very Serious University Reports,
  at work, in the boudoir, all the time.  Wherever I go, people gradually either decide
  that I'm hilarious (if they get it) or incredibly strange (if they don't). \n\nThis
  also means that I get the \"appropriateness\" talk a lot.  Like, at least thrice
  a year, ever since I was in Grade 4 or 5 and started this sort of thing.  I've been
  passed over for some jobs, almost fired from some others, lost marks here and there,
  but most of all, I get the \"appropriateness\" talk. \n\nThe \"appropriateness\"
  talk is a universal constant.  It often starts with something along the lines of
  'did you think that we wouldn't notice?'- Which, of course, I usually nod negatively
  to. Of course I expected them to read these inappropriate things that I wrote- otherwise
  to what purpose would I write them?  \n\nAfter that, they're either a Type A- we'll
  call it the Fuddy Duddy- or a Type B- the Coward. The Type A will tell me that the
  thing that I wrote is directly inappropriate, and not to do it again.  The Type
  B will invoke the potential specter of the Type A- \"Some other people might find
  this inappropriate, so you should be careful about that sort of thing.\"  \n\nThe
  Type B (Coward) is occasionally a free-spirit who has been crushed by a Type A (Fuddy
  Duddy)- who then starts believing (falsely) that everybody is a Fuddy Duddy as well.
  Occasionally, however, the Coward is a Fuddy Duddy in denial or disguise- invoking
  a straw-man Fuddy Duddy to further their Type-A arguments.  \n\nIt's this same mentality
  that makes Political Correctness and Business Casual the norm- one Type A (Fuddy
  Duddy) can spawn many Type B (Cowards), and the Fuddy Duddy can then disguise himself
  as one of the Cowards. \n\nYou'll find, however, that many people enjoy a dash of
  inappropriate humour with their day-to-day reading.  Injecting it into boring project
  documentation can make it more fun to write and read.   Writing a test is a horrifying
  experience, and marking is a painful chore- a creative answer can really perk things
  up. \n\nI've also found that such inappropriate humour usually ends with one of
  five different outcomes - here I'm using academia as an example, but it's the same
  for work environments:\n\n<ul>\n<li> No change in mark- maybe combined with a question
  mark. </li>\n<li> The Type B (Coward) speech. The warning that 'while professor/TA
  doesn't mind, there will come a time when some other professor/TA will mind, so
  be more careful/prudent.' No change in mark. </li>\n<li> The Type A (Fuddy Duddy)
  speech. \"This is not appropriate\"/\"This is not appreciated\". Slight/severe loss
  of marks. </li>\n<li> Smiley face. Your TA/Professor, bored with reading the standard
  papers over and over again, has had a good chuckle reading your inappropriate comments.
  </li>\n<li> Bonus marks. Your TA/Professor not only had a good laugh at your antics,
  but evaluated your work more favourably because of it. </li> \n</ul>\n\nGiven these
  outcomes, and the surprisingly low number of *actual* Type A's, I've recieved the
  Type B speech far, <em>far</em> more often than I've ever faced any sort of actual
  consequences for my actions.  \n\nOn top of that, the consequences are rarely more
  than a slap on the wrist- a small price for being my usual distinctive self.  As
  a cherry on top, the fifth occurrence, \"Bonus Marks\", while rare, is nice, and
  seems to actually get more frequent as I get older and (I assume) more people are
  sucked into the Type B trap of professionalism. \n\nOf course, it can go too far-
  I still have to complete all of the required work.  Humour shouldn't be a way to
  avoid the task at hand- just a distinctive flair.\n\nWith all of the risks associated,
  you might ask- why do I do it? Why do I put myself out there?  A bad joke on a cover
  letter will disqualify me from more jobs than it will qualify me for.\n\nIt's simple-
  if people don't like it, they're not going to like me, and I'm probably not a good
  fit for their company. Any environment that doesn't appreciate the bad humour- I'm
  probably not going to be happy there.  That's why I've started doing it right on
  my cover letter.  The company that reads a bad joke of mine and goes 'this guy...
  I like this guy!'... well, chances are, that is the company that I wanted to work
  for all along."
