content: ! "Something about my site design was starting to get to me.  Too ... busy.
  \ Too much gunk.\n\nSo I tore it all down, and replaced it with much, much less.
  \n\n<pre>\nbody\n{ \n    /* A non-white background color to reduce glare and eyestrain.
  */\n    background-color: #EEE;\n}\n\n#page{\n    /* A reasonable maximum width,
  past which text blocks become unreadably long. */\n    max-width: 550px;\n    /*
  Centered, for your comfort and mine. */\n    margin: auto;\n    /* A little bigger,
  to accomodate for my tiny eyes. */\n    font-size: 1.1em;\n    /* With breathing
  room between the lines. */\n    line-height: 1.4em;\n    /* And using a font that's
  reasonably readable, and staggeringly common. */\n    font-family: Georgia, \"Times
  New Roman\", Times, serif;\n}\n\nh2{\n    /* We don't want too much space between
  the titles and the text. */\n    margin-bottom: 5px;\n}\n\nh2 a{\n    /* And the
  bright-blue links for article titles is distracting. */\n    color: #111122;\n    /*
  Might as well take away the wee underlines, too. */\n    text-decoration: none;\n}\n\n#page
  img{\n    /* Center any images */\n    display: block;\n    margin: auto;\n}\n\nblockquote\n{\n
  \   /* And finally, display blockquotes in italics. */\n    font-style: italic;\n}\n</pre>\n\nIt's
  not much - it's really, really not much - but it's something to build on.  It also
  made me thankful, as always, that I ripped the default Wordpress theme to shreds
  and replaced it with some very, very light markup.  Even minimual styling makes
  the site usable. Of course, if you really want usable blogs without any sort of
  functional styling, you could always talk to my friend <a href=\"http://yangman.ca/\">Yang</a>. "
