  />\n\nTuesday, after the FedEx internet thing, I managed to haul some basic groceries
  home. Some eggs, bacon, milk, juice, bread, and apples.\n\nThe 24-hour grocery store
  was everything I was expecting- lots of dry goods at high markups, a few bits of
  so-called 'produce', and some random household supplies.\n\nI was solidly expecting
  a real supermarket at Farah Foods, but what I encountered was, in fact, almost exactly
  the same as what I found at the 24-hour foodmart- 'discount produce' (*shudder*),
  no meat, and shelves full of expensive dry goods. I ended up picking up a pizza
  for dinner. \n\nSources lead me to believe that there is a Sobey's nearby where
  good groceries can be procured. I certainly hope so.\n\nBreakfast for myself was
  a bit of an ordeal.  I discovered that we have (in fact) no toaster, so I fried
  myself up two slices of bread.  Fried bread kinda sucks.  The 'fresh' bread that
  I picked up from the Farah Foods was already a bit stale, so it's toast or nothing
  for it.  There are three frying pans- each about 4-5 inches in diameter. One of
  them is made of aluminum (like a camp pan), one of them is made of some sort of
  shiny tinlike substance (steel?), and one of them is an actual Teflon pan that looks
  like someone's taken some steel wool and scrubbed mercilessly for hours.  My eggs
  broke and it took two pans to cook the bacon.\n\nI've met my first two roommates.
  \ Roommate #4, a RIM employee, doesn't arrive until this Saturday, I've heard.  \n\nTim
  is another RIM employee.  He's an IAT student, working as a Multimedia Coordinator
  at RIM.  He's new, too, and we're both at the RIM Orientation together.\n\nMike
  is also a RIM employee (that makes all of us), but renewing his employment.  He's
  a Waterloo native, and a gaming enthusiast, which means he was capable of filling
  the house with assorted equipment. We have a huge television, a modded 360 and Wii,
  and he has a computer that makes my loins tingle.  Turning it on causes power surges,
  and it's monitors are independantly larger than my home computer. Mike's in testing
  at RIM. \n\nHaving my fill of exploring Waterloo- which was closed all day, anyways-
  I consented to chill on the couch and play Super Paper Mario.  Having ownership
  of all of my assorted beverages, I drank right out of the carton. Oh yeah- freedom.
  \n\nThis morning, I woke up at 6:30AM.  Then I moaned a bit and wished death upon
  those persons involved in the production and sale of alarm clocks. \n\nI onned my
  pants and shirted my shirt.  I spent some time playing Super Paper Mario to kill
  some time, and walked with Tim to RIM 10.\n\nWe spent time waiting for buses (fun!)
  and riding in buses (fun!). We've all been ushered into a hall, and we're listening
  to presentations. The presentations have been largely 'Rah Rah We Love RIM' sort
  of things, or reams of boring information about health, safety and legal protocols,
  occasionally broken up by cheap food or bathroom breaks with irritating music. Celebrate
  good times, come on!\n\nBased on some information from the big employment package
  I've been given, my work Blackberry (which I should be getting soon) doesn't come
  with voice access- I'm going to have to get a cel-phone.  I'm thinking a pay-as-you-go
  kinda thing- I don't need minutes, and people can call me all they want.\n\nSo,
  during lunch, I discovered that the hall has free wireless access. Laptop out!\n\nI'll
  see you later!"
