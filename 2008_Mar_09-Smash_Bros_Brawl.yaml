  Brawl. \n\nWell, I also cracked open a fresh Wii, and a couple of Wiimotes, some
  nunchuks, a bunch of cords, and a snazzy new hat. Today has been an expensive day,
  for me.\n\nSo, what do I think of Smash Bros. Brawl?  I'm sure you're just dying
  to know. You're all hanging with bated breath at my every word. THE POWER! OH THE
  ... let's just move on.\n\nIt's exactly the same as Smash Bros. Melee. \n\nWhat
  about the controls? \n\nEven playing with the Wiimote, after a while you feel like
  you're playing a slightly-clumsy version of Smash Bros. Melee. The best way to play
  is with a Gamecube controller, which has maintained an almost perfect adaptation
  from the original.  \n\nJust starting the game from scratch, we have a group of
  well-known-and-loved Smash Bros. characters.  Mario, Peach, Zelda, Link, Bowser,
  Yoshi, Kirby, Marth, Pikachu, Ness, boring, boring, boring.  Some of the new characters
  are.. well, really, just old characters- now there's a new counterpart to Ness,
  Lucas, who plays almost exactly the same as Ness.  Laazy. \n\nKing Dedede throws
  Waddle-Dees and Waddle-Doos. This is an awesome ability, and there needs to be more
  of this in every game, ever. \n\nI was hoping for more characters from different
  games, though - of the 12 new characters added to Brawl, 8 are inconsequential characters
  from games/universes that were already there. The other four are Pit (from Kid Icarus),
  Olimar (from Pikmin), Sonic (from Sonic), and Solid Snake (from Barbie's Horse Adventures.)

  alt=\"Solid Snake\" />\nWe haven't unlocked Solid Snake yet. He seems kind of <a
  href=\"http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=196\">out of place</a>. \n\nFinally,
  the game introduces \"Final Smashes\", which are just excessively powerful screen-clearing
  special moves that can only be used if you catch the \"Final Smash\" item and beat
  the bejeesus out of it. \n\nSo- Smash Bros. Brawl.  If you loved the other two,
  you'll love this one!  If you hated the other two, you'll hate this one!  And the
  toolboxes who played constantly and beat you <em>every single time</em> before..
  will beat you every single time again.  \n"
