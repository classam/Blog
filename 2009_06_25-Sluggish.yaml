  Twitter.  That wouldn't be a problem, except the Javascript UI elements running
  the left-side of the page wait for the site to load completely before they kick
  in- so new visitors get a few seconds of ugly UI-less page while waiting for the
  Twitter feed to load, then the whole thing folds up into a tidy accordion. \n\nHum.
