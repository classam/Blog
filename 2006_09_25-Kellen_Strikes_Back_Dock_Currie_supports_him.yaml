content: ! 'In recent news, it looks like Kellen has decided to take offense at my
  series of attacks on the current humour page.

  Dock, too.

  And, of course, because I posted it on my blog, as opposed to sending an e-mail
  directly to The Peak ("Re: The Suckage") , it''s an underhanded, sneaky attack behind
  Kellen Powell''s back.


  I''d like to know exactly what I''m ''plagurizing'', Kellen. I have no idea how
  one would respond to the rest of your claims.


  And Dock? My humour page was not a fantastic example of what a humour page should
  be, I agree.

  The number of good, contributing cartoonists @ SFU is very, very low. Mike Hingston
  is good, you''re good, <a href="http://nofools.livejournal.com">No Fools</a> is
  fantastic.  I''m filler, with an occasional "Oho, that''s a bit of a chuckle!".
  Based on that, I''d say that The Peak barely has the infrastructure to support a
  one-page Humour section.  One solution is to import good stuff from t3h internets
  (Like Sam &amp; Fuzzy, Achewood, even The PBF).  Another solution is to run a tiny
  humour page, maybe one or two good comics hidden in the Arts section.  A third solution
  would be to find some *good* cartoonists at SFU, but I have no idea how they would
  be unearthed. Subliminal messaging?

  curtis, curtis, curtis


  i was doing my daily google of my name and low and behold what have we here.


  wingnuts, for what its worth, is made by probably two of the nicest people i have
  ever met, and they clearly put more work into it than anyone else who submits [with
  the exception of vietnam vet], also, i happen to think running wingnuts is funny
  (that is not to say to that i necessarily think wingnuts is funny).


  also, PEOPLE LIKE PHOTOS AND TEXT. ITS THE HUMOUR SECTION, NOT THE “CUTE COMICS”
  SECTION. as for sam and fuzzy, why would i run something people can read on the
  internet any time they want already? if i was going to run any webcomic, it would
  be achewood.


  you need to accept that you have a terrible sense of humor and a boring overused
  drawing style.


  i told almost evil they could submit but they haven’t given me anything, i’m fine
  with it. i actually plan on doing a full page of only written submissions a week
  by the time the semester is over.


  oh, and i’ve read enough web comics to know that everything you’ve ever done borders
  on blatant plagurism. i never said anything to anyone at the peak don’t worry, i
  wouldn’t want to embarass you like that. besides, i’m not the kind of guy that talks
  shit behind someones back…


  ---------------------------------


  Don’t talk shit on the internet unless you are a. telling the truth or b. willing
  to fight about it.


  I don’t think you are either.


  Warren’s dream admitedly has it’s ups and downs, and Kellen is like a Japanese Noise
  Rock collective in that he likely has as many brilliant ideas as he does terrible
  ones.


  But your section in the peak, Curtis, was the worst that the peak has ever been,
  ever.


  It can only get better.
