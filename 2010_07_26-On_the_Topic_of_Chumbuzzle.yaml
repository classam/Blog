  Good afternoon, the internet. I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of made-up beverages,
  have just invented a beverage.


  I call it Chumbuzzle.  Here''s how it''s made.


  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

  <ul>

  <li>2oz white spiced rum</li>

  <li>orange zest</li>

  <li>lemon zest</li>

  <li>kiwi zest</li>

  <li>Zest brand soap</li>

  <li>2oz Smeshkylovka vodka</li>

  <li>leftover take-out chinese food</li>

  <li>orange juice</li>

  <li>2oz Peach Shnapps</li>

  <li>cherry syrup</li>

  <li>a bartender</li>

  <li>2oz Southern Comfort</li>

  <li>2oz Scope Mouthwash</li>

  </ul>


  <h3>Construction</h3>

  <ul>

  <li>Pour the rum, vodka, Southern Comfort, peach schnapps, and Scope into a small
  metal bucket with some chilled marbles.  Ensure that you use only high-quality marbles
  for this. Swish the liquid ingredients around with the cold marbles for 52 seconds,
  or until you are bored. </li>

  <li>Sprinkle the orange and lemon zests on top. Eat the kiwi zest. It may be furry,
  but power through it. Be a man. </li>

  <li>In a separate small metal bucket, combine the Zest soap and the take-out with
  salad tongs.</li>

  <li>Ceremonial Chumbuzzle dance.  Left, left, right, right, pelvic thrust, pelvic
  thrust, sprinkler.  Remember, silly dances are like life''s cheat codes. </li>

  <li>Throw out both metal buckets. Ask the bartender to make a ''Chumbuzzle''.  Explain
  that it''s just a rum and coke with a silly name. </li>

  </ul>'
