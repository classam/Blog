  articles expound endlessly on a topic that is completely and utterly ridiculous.</em>\n\nGood
  afternoon, the internet. I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of automation and scheduling,
  have pre-scheduled each \"On the Topic of\" post this week.\n\n\"Why?\", you might
  ask, perhaps followed by \"why should we care?\". Maybe even \"who are you, and
  why are you in my house, standing over me while I sleep, breathing deeply and clutching
  a vegetable peeler to your chest.\"  Yes, I get that last one a lot. \n\nIt's simple,
  various readers. Because I can try to keep a more reasonable schedule, writing whenever
  the mood strikes me and then pushing my various insane thoughts into the queue.
  \ That even gives me more time to adapt, alter, adjust, poke, prod, pontificate,
  edit, elucidate, and ... um... egg.  Additional editing shouldn't really clear up
  my lunatic writing style, though, so it's not really a win for anybody. \n\nThe
  most major benefit, however, is clear. Any time I schedule anything on a computer,
  it feels like I am commanding a tiny army of unreliable robot servants &mdash; something
  that most of my friends should know is a pretty heady feeling. Someday, if I keep
  this going, I might not be the only one standing over people while they sleep, breathing
  deeply and clutching a vegetable peeler.  There might be tiny, unreliable robot
  servants, too. I'd imagine they would be holding a tarp. "
