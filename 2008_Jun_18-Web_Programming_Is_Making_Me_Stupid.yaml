  Horror</a>, I'm realizing that- as a web programmer- I'm abstracted away from a
  lot of the deep-magic of actual Computer Stuff.  \n\nWhen it comes down to it, I
  know the basics about data structures and algorithmic complexity- but it's fuzzy
  and only getting fuzzier.  I don't know what the worst-case insertion time of a
  hashtable, nor do I even remember what a 'priority queue' is. \n\nI suppose I should
  put some effort into keeping my 'base CS skills' sharp over time.  If I forget everything,
  what's the point of paying for this expensive degree? "
