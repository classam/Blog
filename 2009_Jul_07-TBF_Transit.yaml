content: ! "I hate transit. \n\nAfter Vancouver's famous Endless Gridlock shut down
  the entire city for three days, I can see why they disallowed driving in the city
  centre.  It's certainly had a positive effect on businesses.  The air is cleaner,
  and there's no way that the city could handle the sheer volume of human that it
  seems to handle now if there were cars in the too-crowded ex-streets. \n\nI just
  can't get the stink of transit off of me, though.  This city has too many people,
  and none of them wear anti-perspirant.  They listen to their music too loud, have
  too many children, and can't seem to manage to move anywhere without shoving me.
  \n\nWalking is little better.  There are too damn many people everywhere.  We need
  a good epidemic to thin the ranks, another Hong Kong Fever.  That'll clear some
  walking room.  \n\nLove & Kisses &mdash; J. Random Hacker"
