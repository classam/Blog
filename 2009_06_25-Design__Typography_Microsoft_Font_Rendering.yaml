  articles cover a topic near and dear to my heart: Making things look pretty. </em>\n\nI've
  been playing around with the new font-embedding features in Firefox and Webkit recently,
  just out of curiosity &mdash; and I've discovered once again that I am absolutely
  in hate with Microsoft's font rendering.  \n\nDespite, say, Jeff Atwood's <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000885.html\">impassioned
  preference for Cleartype</a>, when I'm displaying an OpenType font in Windows, it
  looks bad. Ugly. Fugly.  I suspect that this is because the fonts were designed
  for print, not for display on a monitor, so when Windows's font renderer ham-handedly
  tries to cram them into a pixel grid, the end result ends up being uglier than a
  bad analogy.  I'd also guess that font-hinting at low resolutions is only peripherally
  included in nicer print fonts.  In order to make any embedded fonts look even remotely
  okay in Windows, I had to increase the size of all website text by 110% &mdash;
  which I actually prefer, for readability's sake, so long as none of my website users
  like to browse the page on ancient, tiny screens.  \n\nOn the Macbook, the fonts
  look pristine, pure, and proper, comparatively.\n\n<div class=\"blockscript\">As
  for rendering of my custom-jobbered font, <a href=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/fonts/lassam_blockscript_smallcaps.otf\">Lassam
  Blockscript Smallcaps</a> (Available under a Creative Commons license, so go ahead
  if you want to fiddle with it or use it on your website) - well, once again, the
  Vista computer mangles it into an unreadable mess, and it looks slicker and sexier
  on the Macbook.   I suppose if I ever want to embed my personalized font into my
  webpage, I'm just going to have to learn how to do font-hinting. </div> "
