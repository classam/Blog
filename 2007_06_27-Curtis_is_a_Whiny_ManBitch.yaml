  I''ve come to the conclusion, based on a tonne of evidence, that I strongly dislike
  mathematics.


  Now I''m going well out of my way, through hook or by crook, to finish the mathy
  courses that are left in the CS degree so that I never have to deal with them again.
  My GPA is composed of three groups: Courses that are ridiculously easy (A/A+), Courses
  that are not (B/C+), and Math-based courses (D/C-). I''d be a much happier CS student
  if I could just find a path to a CS degree that doesn''t involve these courses at
  all.


  In fact, I''d probably have been way happier (overall) if I had just gone to BCIT,
  being as how I just wanted a top-notch learning experience in ''How to build and
  sell software'' and not, say, how to calculate the running time of a m0rgesort..


  Ah, well, live and learn. (Well, live and learn everything but 307, which continues
  to baffle my tiny, uninterested peanut brain)'
