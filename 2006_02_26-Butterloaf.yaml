content: ! 'What''s Curtis working on right now?


  Aside from trying to learn C++, working at a hotel job, performing TA duties, trying
  to spend some time with his girlfriend, and taking a Calculus course, Curtis is
  working on developing a serial comic strip. It''s going to look snazzy, and it''s
  going to fit in your standard <a href="http://www.kingfeatures.com/subg.htm">syndication
  submission package</a>. Then, Curtis is going to make many copies and send them
  to your local comic syndicates, in hopes of being sold to newspapers.


  Remember, folks, the minute Curtis <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Freezes_Over">gets
  a job as a cartoonist</a>, the rest of the education gets put on hold. But the 3:5000
  odds really don''t look good in Curtis''s favour.


  Curtis has a snazzy preview graphic, but it needs to be scanned and photoshopped,
  so it''ll be awhile.'
