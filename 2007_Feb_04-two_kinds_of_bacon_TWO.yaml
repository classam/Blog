content: ! 'I slept through the Superbowl.

  (Oh, and while you were smugly watching it ''for the commercials'', someone stole
  your car.)


  It would be a tragedy if I.. you know.. followed football, or cared about the Superbowl,
  or anything like that.

  I think Kristen was rooting for Chicago. (DA BEARS!) Was Chicago in the superbowl,
  then? I''m confused.

  Oh, but I had my fair share of awesome weekend this weekend.  On Saturday, me and
  Kristen went to my mom''s house, ate a breakfast that could destroy the world (There
  were TWO KINDS OF BACON) and met the twin sons of my cousin. (I think they''re "Once
  Removed" or something.) Kristen was affected by a powerful airborne chemical secreted
  by babies (Babitoxin) that induces mild brain damage- so she spent the greater part
  of the morning happily clutching a baby, cooing and rocking and grinning.


  Later, we went with Dad, Tracy & my brother to the Rosa''s. It''s a little Italian
  restaurant in Coquitlam- the food is good and plentiful. Delicious free bread, a
  caprese salad (Okay, caprese salad is just soft, white cheese, tomatoes, purple
  onions, capers, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar, but it''s de-licious), and more
  delicious free bread. Dad & my younger brother got racks of ribs served with plates
  of pasta. Tracy had the prime rib (served with the most delicious mushrooms ever)
  and I shared the Cannelloni with Kristen. Then? Cheesecake.


  After that, we drove to Vancouver for the Barenaked Ladies concert. I haven''t been
  to a concert in.. well.. ever (excluding the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, which
  put me to sleep), so I wasn''t sure what to expect.   It started a little boring
  and slow- some guy named ''Toni Squish'' or ''Todd Squick'' or something started
  out the show, and the combination of warm stadium, big meal and slow, boring lullaby-like
  music almost knocked me clean unconscious- and I thought either he was deliberately
  difficult to understand or the acoustics of the stadium are terrible, ''cause I
  could only understand about 1/3 of what he was saying. (Turns out it was ''both''-
  the Barenaked Ladies were much clearer but understanding what they were saying was
  still difficult at times.) Of course, part of the problem of being unable to clearly
  hear what was going on was due to our position in the ''cheap seats''. (There was
  1 row behind us. They were in the ''marginally cheaper'' seats, I guess.)

  So the opening act sucked- but when the Barenaked Ladies came on, everything started
  being entertaining.  They started with a few of the ballads from their newer CD''s,
  most of which I''ve hated - but they segued into some of their older songs (woo!)
  and generally increased the level of ''energy'' and ''awesomeness''. Also? The song
  "Bank Job", ''cause it''s about robbing a bank full of nuns. They also tossed in
  some impromptu Vancouver-based humour. (We love Vancouver very much~ we ski at Mt.
  Seymour and eat at De-Dutch!)

  Of course, one can never be very sure about how off-the-cuff stage-humour is, especially
  in song form- but the songs were both ridiculously improvised and full of repetition,
  lending a certain credibility to them. Oh, and funny. I''m guessing the jokes were
  worked out beforehand but the execution was put together on the spot.

  Halfway through the show, Ed (A lead singer) made a comment about how a cord was
  running down his back in an uncomfortable manner, and a miscellaneous bald stage-hand
  came out to rescue him.  So he put together a quick melodic riff on how a mysterious
  bald man saved him- and then decided that every bald member of the show''s staff
  should come out and introduce themselves- then coaxed them out by threatening their
  job security. (It''s a bald parade! It''s a bald parade! If you are bald and you
  get paid we''d better see a bald parade! If we don''t see a bald parade then all
  the bald guys won''t get paid...)


  Then, home. Fun was had by all.



  Okay, I''m going to heat up some hot wings. Just ''cause I missed Superbowl doesn''t
  mean I have to miss out on foods with an astonishingly high fat-to-meat ratio.'
