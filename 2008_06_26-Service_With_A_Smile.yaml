  the fast-food outlets in Harbour Centre. Then exit them, because the service is
  crap. Yes, you’re earning minimum wage, but still, take some pride in your work!
  I know I did when I was working retail two years ago. When I order my burger, don’t
  stand around and gossip with the other customers while my food is getting cold.
  I’m looking at you, A&W staff. Don’t be all grouchy and intimidating, Quizno’s lady.
  And most importantly, speak English, Tim Horton’s girl! </blockquote>\n\nand was
  then immediately smacked down by a commenter: \n\n<blockquote>\nSo you’re one of
  those assholes who expects the royal treatment from immigrants and teenagers who
  are stuck working minimum wage food service jobs. Nice! As if those jobs aren’t
  bad enough, they have you demanding they put a fucking bow on your super-sized papa
  burger combo.\n</blockquote>\n\nNow, here's the deal.  Currently, in Vancouver,
  we have a huge shortage of high-quality teenagers and easily-taken-advantage-of
  immigrants- that is, people who are willing to work hard for low pay, on account
  of their lack of experience and part-time requirements.  \n\nThis is not a bad thing-
  hard workers are now worth more than the minimum wage.  That's actually great!\n\nFor
  a fast-food restaurant to maintain a dedicated staff, now, they either need to ride
  everybody's ass 100% of the time (at which point they'll quit and get a better job),
  maintain an interesting and exciting job (which is impossible because it's FAST
  FOOD), or pay a little bit more. They can't fire people who aren't good at their
  jobs- there's nobody to replace them!\n\nThe restaurants that aren't willing to
  do these things are not going to end up with the best people- because a better job
  is always just around the corner, and the job market is good. \n\nI have two relatives
  in the food service industry right now.  If you want to sell food, you'll always
  do it better with polite, efficient workers.  This is a hard and fast rule. \n\nIf
  it's in a good area- in a WalMart, or at a Harbour Center, they'll have customers
  no matter how bad their service is. They don't have to pay, they won't.  \n\nSo
  the quality of service in local fast food restaurants- especially ones in high-traffic-areas,
  has been dropping dramatically.  A few weeks ago, I ate at a McDonalds which was
  apparently manned entirely by sullen-looking 14-year-olds.  They were incredibly
  slow, the restaurant was a mess, and they put my pickles <em>outside</em> my burger.
  How do you <strong>fail</strong> at making a <strong>double cheeseburger</strong>?
  It's not that hard!\n\nSlow service from a worker who looks like he'd rather be
  at home?  I don't want to eat there. I <em>do</em> expect better. I will go to a
  different restaurant in the future.  Service matters.  If the restaurant doesn't
  want to pay to maintain a polite, efficient staff, I don't want to pay to eat there.\n\nSo,
  \ yes, I'm one of those assholes who expects the royal treatment from immigrants
  and teenagers who are \"stuck\" working minimum wage food service jobs.  I'm not
  going to try to make their lives more difficult, but if they're terrible at their
  jobs, I'll go somewhere else. (In the case of the SFU pub, that's the Mountain Shadow,
  for example.)\n"
