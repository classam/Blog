content: ! "A quick summary of the happenings, for those people who weren't there:
  \n\n(Angelina) Leukemia, the brave rogue, (Xianny) Eyebrows, the sneaky rogue, (Curtis)
  Richard, <a href=\"http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?page_id=530\">the mage who is also
  a chef</a>, and (Marcel) The Generic Dwarf, met under mysterious circumstances,
  ostensibly because they were all seeking fame, fortune, gold, and adventure. \n\nImmediately
  on their path, they encountered an unfortunate series of<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobold_(Dungeons_&_Dragons)\">
  Kobolds</a>. The Generic Dwarf stood in the centre of their assault, soaking up
  damage and occasionally felling a gnome.  In his capacity as damage-soaker, his
  beard was soaked in both napalm and acid.  The two rogues popped in and out, dealing
  minor damage, and Richard felled Kobolds by the handful with his powerful burst
  attacks. Eventually, the last kobold was felled, minced, and served in a stew that
  was (everyone noticed) quite delicious. \n\nThe characters found themselves upon
  a small settlement- Winterhaven.  While the rest of the team conferred about whether
  or not the city was safe, Richard merrily waved at the town guard, who waved back.
  \ Seems safe enough.  The party walked into the town's tavern and bought a few pitchers
  of ale.  At this time actual beer was brought out (Thanks, Marcel!) and consumed.
  \ It was both cool and refreshing.\n\nAfter a bit of snooping. it was found out
  that the town of Winterhaven had a tad of a Kobold problem.  (Yuh, really?) And
  if the team would be so kind as to clear out the Kobold's nest, there would be mad
  cash in it for them. (Okay, 100 gold pieces and a bottle of fine wine. )\n\nSetting
  off on the road, the team encountered their second set of Kobolds for the day.  The
  Generic Dwarf went back to taking loads of damage, taking hit upon hit and eventually
  deciding that it would be prudent to flee. Richard commented that this makes him
  the \"Worst Dwarf Ever\". Without a thick damage soaker to take the front, the brave
  rogue immediately took a felling blow.  In a halfhearted rescue attempt, Richard
  flooded the battlefield with thunder-wave upon thunder-wave.  The Kobolds were severely
  hurt, but sadly, Leukemia didn't survive.  With naught but a few hit points, a cowardly
  Dwarf, and sneaky, sneaky Eyebrows, Richard thought that an expeditious retreat
  was in order. \n\nRichard dashed away, yelling \"CHEESE IT!\" and leaving Eyebrows
  the Rogue to his own devices.  Eyebrows was knocked unconscious by the Kobolds,
  and Generic Dwarf and Richard booked it back to Winterhaven. \n\nUpon reaching Winterhaven,
  Richard and Generic Dwarf stopped to catch their breath, only to encounter an infurated
  Eyebrows.  He attempted to greet them, knife concealed in his palm, but Richard
  noticed and immediately bellowed \"GUARDS!\".\n\nRichard tensed, Generic Dwarf grabbed
  his Generic Dwarven Weapon, the guards.. guarded... and the session ended, to be
  picked up next day. \n\nAnd now for... D&D Tips!: \n<ul> \n<li> The team doesn't
  need two rogues.  Honestly.  </li>\n<li> Wear all the armour you can.  Know why
  the mage survived? Because unlike most mages, he was wearing Leather Armour. </li>\n<li>
  The only way for a rogue to be really effective is if he has combat advantage -somehow-,
  usually by flanking.  That means you don't go up and try to deal direct from-the-front
  damage- you wait for the enemies to engage the Dwarf and then hit them from behind.</li>\n<li>
  You start out with enough money to buy just about all the equipment you need.  Asking
  quest-givers for more equipment is silly.  The following conversation will never
  happen:\n<ul>\n<li> Questee: We're going to need more equipment to do this quest.
  Hook us up! </li>\n<li> Questor: Oh, glad you asked. We've been keeping this +3
  Sword of Poopflinging just in case somebody asked. </li>\n<li> Questee: Wonderful!
  </li>\n</ul>\n the same goes for advance payment - especially if you're a group
  of shyster-looking unproven heroes.  Maybe if you're super lucky you'll be able
  to finagle a few extra coins.  If you're lucky. </li>\n<li>Team needs moar Cleric
  and Paladin pls. </li>\n<li> If your character is named \"Leukemia\", you're going
  to die in the first game. </li>\n</ul>"
