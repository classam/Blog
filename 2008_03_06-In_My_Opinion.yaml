content: ! "I've been writing in this blog for.. I don't know, a couple of years,
  now? I spend a lot of time reading and writing and trying to understand how to improve
  my own writing. \n\nThe first and foremost thing I've found- quite possibly one
  of the most important lessons that I've learned- is that you should <em>always have
  a strong opinion</em>. \n\nYou should try to avoid littering your writing with words
  that defuse the meaning of what they're trying to say. Let's give an example.\n\n<blockquote>
  In my opinion, Python is likely to be the best currently-available programming language
  for web work.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> Python is the best programming language
  for web work. </blockquote>\n\nWhenever you qualify your statements with \"In my
  opinion\" or \"I think that\", you're sucking all of the authoritativeness right
  out of the statement.  Of course it's your opinion- of course that's what you think!
  \n\nEverything you write has the implicit \"THIS IS MY OPINION\" attached to it
  and you don't need to make that any clearer.\n\nPutting things like that just makes
  it sound like you're trying to cover your ass in case you might be wrong. \"Oh?
  Well, it was just my opinion.\"\n\nEven worse is stacked qualifiers.  \n\n<blockquote><em>In
  my opinion</em>, <em>I would think</em> that I'm <em>probably</em> the best orphan-stacker
  in Vancouver. </blockquote>\n\nWhen you're making a point, just make the point-
  and don't try to tell people that it's just your Humble Opinion. \n"
