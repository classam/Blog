  alt=\"Giant RSS Button\" />\n\nAre you tired of checking your favourite websites
  daily to see if they've posted anything?  It's a pain in the butt, isn't it? \n\nWell,
  worry not! There's a technology specifically designed to check your favourite websites
  *FOR* you and let you know if anything's changed. In fact, it's been around for
  8 years! It's called... RSS!  (Okay, all my friends in the crowd can roll their
  eyes and go back to what they were doing.) \n\nWith a good RSS Reader, you get updated
  whenever one of your favourite website makes an update.  Then, all you need to do
  is check on your RSS Reader once in a while, and you're good.  \n\nThe easiest way
  to use RSS is simply to use <a href=\"http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/products/firefox/\">FireFox</a>'s
  built-in RSS support.  If you're browsing the internet, you're browsing it with
  Internet Explorer or <a href=\"http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/products/firefox/\">FireFox</a>.
  \ Check in the very top top right of your screen- there's either a little blue 'e'
  or a little orange blob doing terrible, unholy things to a little blue blob. If
  it's the 'e', you have Internet Explorer- Shame on you, you should have <a href=\"http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/products/firefox/\">FireFox</a>,
  which is more secure and feature-rich! (FireFox also downloads all of your bookmarks
  and settings from Internet Explorer when you install it, so it's not hard to switch).
  \  If you have the orange and blue blobs in your top-right corner, you're already
  running FireFox. Good for you!\n\nOnce you're browsing the net using FireFox, all
  you need to do is go to an RSS enabled page.  At the very top of the page, next
  to the address-bar, there should be an RSS button.\n<img style=\"float:left;\" src=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/images/rss_example.png\"
  alt=\"RSS Example\" />\nYours will probably be bright orange, lookin' kinda like
  the button at the top of this post.\n\nAfter you click on that RSS button, you'll
  get a prompt asking how you want to subscribe to the feed. \n<img style=\"float:left;\"
  src=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/images/rss_example2.png\" alt=\"RSS Example 2\" />\nIf
  you want to experiment with a real RSS reading program, Google Reader or Bloglines,
  or a downloadable RSS program, these can also be used here.  I'm going to show you
  Live Bookmarks, though. Select Live Bookmarks, and \"Subscribe Now.\"\n\nIt'll ask
  you what you want to name the bookmark, and where you want to put it.  You can just
  leave these things to their default values- although I like to use my Bookmarks
  Toolbar folder to hold things that I visit very frequently - these bookmarks appear
  at all times right under the FireFox address bar. \n\nOnce you're done, in your
  bookmarks folder, a new RSS folder will appear- containing a list of all the posts
  that have been made recently by that website. \n\n<img style=\"float:left;\" src=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/images/rss_example3.png\"
  alt=\"RSS Example 3\" />\n\nIf the site's been updated, a new post will appear at
  the top of the list. \n\nIf you're using <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/view/#overview-page\">Google
  Reader </a> or <a href=\"http://www.bloglines.com/\"> Bloglines</a>, you just need
  to log in to your Google Reader or Bloglines accounts, and they'll display a list
  of all of the sites that've been updated recently.\n\nIf you read a group of websites
  compulsively- say, <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/\">Joel on Software</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/\">Coding Horror</a>, <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/\">Paul
  Graham's Essays</a>,  <a href=\"http://software.ericsink.com/\">Eric Sink's Blog</a>,
  \ <a href=\"http://www.randsinrepose.com/\">Rands In Repose</a>, <a href=\"http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/\">Steve
  Yegge's Blog</a>, or heck, even a *tonne of webcomics*... RSS becomes an invaluable
  tool. "
