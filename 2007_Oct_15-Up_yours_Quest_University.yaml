  />\n\nFor a long, long time, I've had a beef with private schools. I think that
  it's right to ban private schools, and I'm happy to be in a country that only allows
  for religious private schools.\n\nI don't think that private schools are good for
  a free-market capitalism.  A major tenet of a capitalist is that \"if you are clever,
  and work hard enough, you should be able to live comfortably or even affluently.\"
  The people who are more likely to support every-man-for-himself style economics
  tend to be people who have busted their asses and put together comfortable lifestyles
  just on the sweat of their brow. \n\nHere's the argument- \"The public school system
  is terrible- and we have money- shouldn't we have the right to spend money and put
  our children though a better school system?\".\n\nNO! By putting your children through
  a separate school system, you're making it easier for them and harder for everybody
  else.  \"That's my right as a parent\", you might think, but that is a slippery
  slope. \n\nLet's see what happens if everybody does what you do.  Private schools
  become big and popular, and in order to succeed, your child probably needs to go
  to a good private school.  The only people who have any vested interest in how public
  schools are run are now people who can't afford to send their children to private
  school- people with the least political clout and the least money.  Public schools
  rot away and become all-but useless- maybe someone from public school, with sufficient
  grit and intelligence and hard-work, can pull himself out of the system and get
  a scholarship to a major private school, but this is very rare and very difficult.
  \  \n\nSo now, we've violating a fundamental tenet of capitalism- the one where
  anybody, if they're intelligent and hard-working, can be successful.  People who
  go to private schools can be pretty successful, even if they're not that intelligent
  or hard-working. People who go to public schools are basically shafted from the
  get-go unless they are superhuman workaholic geniuses who happen not to get stabbed
  or shot along the way.\n\nThanks to the fact that money becomes as important to
  success as, say, hard work, or intelligence- the amount of *intelligence* and *hard-work*
  decreases, and everyone ends up more useless as a result.  (Subtle poke at the failing
  two-tier American education system.)\n\nSo here, we have a system where the people
  who are successful are not the people who work the hardest, but the people who are
  the children of other people who have lots of money.  Waaait, that's not right.
  That's inefficient is what it is. \n\nIf everybody is forced into a single-tier
  system, everybody gets the same chance to work hard.  If the public school system
  starts to suck terribly, people who are rich get pissed off about it- and they have
  political clout and money. They'll join the PTA, raise money, and change things-
  but every kid gets the same advantage and the win still goes to the smartest and
  the hardest workers.\n\nOnce everyone gets out of school, the free market is fair
  enough.  If you didn't have the common sense to pay attention when the teacher was
  telling you how to conjugate a participle or what the atomic mass of Hydrogen is,
  well, you know that you passed up an opportunity to have a higher income and a better
  job. You can always go back and try again. \n\nBut right up until that point, you
  deserve the ability to prove that you are a smarter, harder worker than everybody
  else, and no amount of buying power on the part of somebody else's parents should
  be able to negate that advantage.\n\nI also don't like high University tuition,
  expensive prep-programs, or after-school tutoring- these are just more ways for
  rich kids to get an advantage over hard-working kids.\n\nOkay, here's another complaint.
  \"Why should I have to pay for someone else's education?\".  Here's why- first of
  all, like I said, it's only fair that everybody get the same advantage from the
  beginning. If someone's going to be poor, it should at least because they made bad
  choices instead of because they were born that way.  With a good public education
  system, there are just more well-educated, well-trained employees out there- these
  are people who lower the price of white-collar work and pay their own hefty taxes
  into the system. Additionally, because everybody is just that much more inclined
  to believe in the dream of 'work hard and live comfortably', everybody works harder.
  \ Productivity goes up.\n\nSo, finally, \"Why should I have to pay for some freeloading
  jackass who just plays Ultimate Frisbee all day?\"  Well, this is an easy one- University
  is hard.  There are a few freeloaders, but they find their way on to Academic Probation
  pretty quickly, and eventually they are out on their collective asses.  Because
  of the limited amount of seats, when University education is cheap, it's *VERY*
  competitive and *VERY* difficult- and the cheaper it is, the more people fight tooth
  and nail to get at those precious seats.  \n\nThe combination of higher-tuition
  and lower-population has forced our poor Universities to lower their admission standards
  from the 90%'s to the 80%'s and now the 70%'s. (When I got in, it was the 80%'s,
  and it was a pretty close call, at that)  This is the sort of thing that is *bad*-
  it results in a dumbing down of the education- the differentiator vis-a-vis University
  becomes much more financial than educational, and that lowers the value of the education.
  \ \n\nThat is why I get in such an tizzy about anything that even approaches private
  school.\n\nI don't get in such a busy-fit about Religious Private education, because
  while those kids might be getting a more expensive education, it comes with a lot
  of superstitious nonsense and just plain-old premium-grade bullshit.  I'm sure it
  balances out- a more expensive education combined with a mental crutch that will
  be with you for the rest of your life. TIE!"
