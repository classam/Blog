  ) has me thinking about a few hard-and-fast laws that I keep in my head when I'm
  thinking about website design. \n\nI quoted \"Nobody Wants To Register For Anything,
  Ever\" like it was a well-defined rule that everybody understands, without really
  qualifying it.  Of course, I assume everybody knows this about the internet, but
  I thought I might share my too-obvious-to-need-discussing rules, anyways. \n\n<h3>
  Nobody Wants To Register For Anything, Ever </h3>\nThis seems practically given,
  but you'd be surprised at how loosely people seem to understand this rule.  Registration
  for a site is a pain in the pooper. Nobody wants to do it. The only way to get someone
  to register a name and user combination for a site is to convince them that there
  is some tangible benefit.  \n\n<strong>Landing pages</strong> often (and should!)
  offer big, bright sales-pitches telling everybody about how amazing the product
  is, why they will love it, and to register now - it's free! <a href=\"http://www.mint.com/\">Mint.com
  understands</a> - setting up a Mint account involves no small amount of effort,
  so they are sure to prime potential registrants with a big sales pitch to get them
  through the process. \n\nSome sites offer live demos of their product - <strong>Lazy
  Registration</strong> and <strong>Anonymous Participation</strong> are strong techniques
  for getting people involved enough in a site that they want to register.  Amazon.com
  knows lazy registration - as users browse their site, they gather data about them,
  building a shopping cart and a pile of 'preferences', and soon users start to see
  why they might want to register.\n\nDevelopers have to understand that <em>users
  must be <del>coerced</del> convinced to register.</em> \n\n<h3> The Longer A Registration
  Takes, The Less Likely Somebody Will Do It </h3> \nOf course, the easier a registration
  is, the more likely it is that a user will get across the finish line.  For every
  step, every bit of user data that the developer requests, the user has to take a
  bit of time waiting, filling out forms, and wondering exactly why JimBob's Bacon
  Factory needs his e-mail address and phone number. \n\nSeriously, I am pretty unfriendly
  towards an as-yet-unused web service or store I've signed up for sending me a status
  update that means nothing to me.  Some sort of direct interaction that I would have
  otherwise missed? (\"apike has commented on your blog!\") - welcome.  Discount offers
  and sales? Slightly relevant.  Newsletters? Don't care.  And the poor behavior of
  some web services with my e-mail address makes me less likely to want to give it
  out again in the future.  Yes, as a <em>developer</em>, I know we take down e-mail
  addresses in order to offer password recovery as a feature.  As a <em>user</em>,
  though, I don't care enough about my account to _want_ password recovery.  Security
  questions are even worse.\n\nThe worst thing in the world - when I go to a site,
  I want to use a service, they ask me to register, take down my address, e-mail,
  phone number, zip code, and blood type, and then tell me that I can't register because
  I've <em>already registered</em> with that e-mail account.  I can't log-in, because
  I've forgotten my password, so now I have to go through whatever convoluted password-retrieval
  they have set up.  I am then assigned a safe, secure password (\"x871@@moobs\")
  by some internal process, one that I would be totally unwilling to memorize on my
  own, and mention that I can go through the even-more-obscure process of changing
  it- without even offering a link.  I guess I'll have to learn enough about their
  system to go into the site preferences.  Ultimately, the point of this entire escapade
  is ... to view an article.  Way to GO, Linux Magazine, New York Times, or whatever,
  you have successfully made me utterly unwilling to try to view articles on your
  website. \n\nSavvy internet users just have a 'throwaway' identity that they use
  for every crappy website registration in the world.  One name, one e-mail address,
  one password, endlessly reusable.  Of course, being as different websites have different
  requirements for passwords (\"Your password must be at least 8 characters long,
  composed of letters and numbers, and cannot start with a dictionary word.\") - a
  single password doesn't always work.  They think they're promoting security, but
  what they are actually promoting is me using a throwaway password (\"fuckthisshit99281\"),
  saving their password in GMail (insecure!), and eventually leaving their site and
  never coming back.  What, do they think, I'm going to give them my secure passphrase
  (or, worse, construct a new one) for their half-assed non-existant \"social networking\"
  features?  I want security from e-commerce solutions and my student account - from
  everything else, I just want convenience. \n\nreddit is, in my opinion, the no-contest
  <em>king</em> of the registration world.  reddit offers Anonymous Participation,
  but it shows the user buttons that he really wants to press. Oh, he wants to press
  'em bad.  But when he does, it tells him that in order to participate, he needs
  to register. The horror! Okay, he's not going to go to all that trouble just to
  tell the world that he likes Onion articles. Here's the thing, though - the registration
  is all right there in front of him, and it looks so easy - they don't even need
  his e-mail address- how could he lose?  It's <em>sales-pitch and quick registration
  all in a devastatingly effective one-two punch</em>.  Sure, sometimes people lose
  accounts because they don't remember the password and they didn't include an e-mail
  address, but it's reddit- the stakes are low and re-registration takes 3 seconds.
  \ \n\nBam.\n\n\n"
