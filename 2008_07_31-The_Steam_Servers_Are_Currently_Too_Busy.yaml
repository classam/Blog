content: ! "There's a hidden downside to Steam.  \n\nHere I am, wanting to play Team
  Fortress 2, online.  I've purchased the game, I should be allowed to play it whenever
  I damn well feel like it, right?\n\nWrong.\n\n\"The Steam servers are currently
  too busy to handle your request. Please try again in a few minutes.\"\n\nThis is
  the thing that has people all up-in-arms about digital distribution systems- I don't
  give a flying fuck if Steam's servers are down. I just want to play Team Fortress
  2.  The Steam servers should have nothing to do with it.  And what if Steam goes
  out of business? Do I lose the ability to play all of my games forever? \n\nI hate
  CD's, so digital distribution is definitely the way to go.. that or piracy- but
  I wish it didn't suck so much."
