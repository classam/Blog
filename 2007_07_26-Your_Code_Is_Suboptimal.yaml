  I finally got my t-shirt from SourceGear.  I've always been a fan of <a href=\"http://www.ericsink.com/\">Eric
  Sink's blog</a>- while it may not be the most attractive thing on the internet,
  his series are educational and interesting to read. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.sourcegear.com/\">SourceGear
  </a> is largely for developers who have been stuck with Microsoft's terrible <a
  href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718670.aspx\">SourceSafe</a> repository
  system.  It's designed to be an easy switch from SourceSafe to SourceGear, and a
  much more economical, powerful, safe and speedy source control system.  It's a niche
  market of a niche market, but I'm sure anybody who's ever made the switch has been
  more than happy. \n\nWell, reading Eric Sink's blog, I came upon an offer for a
  free T-shirt.  A T-Shirt featuring a glowering evil individual. \"Your Code is Suboptimal\".\n\nOf
  course I snapped it up. I love free T-shirts! I love mocking the code of others!
