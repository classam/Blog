content: ! "I just placed a new Amazon order, because Amazon orders consistently fill
  me with glee.  It's like Christmas, except you don't know when it's going to arrive
  and all of the presents are exactly what you want. \n\nA stack of classic dystopia,
  another stack on fiction writing theory, and then \"The Practice of System and Network
  Administration\" and \"Founders at Work\" (because I'm seriously enjoying \"Coders
  at Work\").  I've barely even made a dent in my last order - but working through
  all of the THICK TECH GOODNESS is going to take some time, and I need some more
  chillin' and not thinkin' too hard about stuff. \n\nI wouldn't even have mentioned
  it, but my <a href=\"http://realcurtislassam.tumblr.com/post/275496823/holy-bombastic-book-buying-batman\">Surprisingly
  Intuitive Doppelganger</a> beat me to the punch, so I thought that I might ... I
  don't know, post something. I guess.\n\nPlus, I'm stuck in farm county... at least
  until I have a job where a place of my own, perhaps one with a shorter commute,
  would be a distinct benefit.  So... not until at least next July, when I start working
  for Telus as a <em>faceless drone.</em> "
