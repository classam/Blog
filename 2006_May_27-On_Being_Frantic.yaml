content: ! "Ah, yesterday, I managed to pull off the X-Men Day and the Humour Page,
  and considering the amount of frantic speed I had going during the day, it was pretty
  hitch free.\nExcept for the following:\n1. Forgot to add Dan to the ticket list
  and thusly buy tickets for him.\n2. Humour page looks odd in places. I say, you
  can't have straight lines around the comics if the contributors don't draw 'em that
  way! \n3. The television and DVD were unguarded for at least 15 minutes. Theft =
  MY DEATH.\n\nIf you're wondering, the X-Men Day was a showing of both X-Men and
  X2 in the ASB Atrium, followed by a ROAD TRIP! to see X3 in theatres on it's premiere
  night. \nWe'll be doing the same thing with Pixar movies when Cars comes out! (In
  2 weeks? I think?)\n \nI really feel energized. Having it all done at the end of
  the day, plus the 12+ hours of sleep I got.. like a million bucks, I feel!"
