  articles expound endlessly on a variety of topics completely and utterly ridiculous.</em>\n\nGood
  afternoon, the internet. I, Curtis Lassam, tireless champion of putting things in
  my mouth, have just discovered the magic of Chili Oil. \n\nHon's Wun Tun House is
  a local emporium where inexpensive noodles and dumplings can be had.  It changed
  hands, recently, and now seems almost consistently to be dirty and greasy... and
  surprisingly satisfying. \n\nIn my opinion, this is at least partially due to their
  pots of chili oil. These pots, however, can be acquired, separately from the greasy
  noodles, and taken home for a small fee.  They are composed of a staggering amount
  of oil, garlic, dried chiles, and good ol' Vitamin MSG.  Said oil tastes good on
  anything.  Even Kraft Dinner, with pepper and chili oil, starts to taste like real
  food. \n"
