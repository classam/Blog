  book</a> that Orson Scott Card released. Here's some of Amazon's description:\n\n<blockquote>Citing
  his pacifist religious beliefs, Zeck refuses to participate in any simulated war
  games, but when he sees a Dutch student give a friend a small present in celebration
  of Sinterklaas Day, he reports the violation of the school's rules against open
  religious observation and sparks an uproar over religious freedom and the significance
  of cultural traditions. Meanwhile, Zeck becomes a pariah until series hero Ender
  Wiggin finds a way to show him the real meaning of the holidays. Exploring themes
  of tolerance and compassion, this story about stuffing stockings is, fittingly,
  a perfect stocking stuffer for science fiction fans of all ages.</blockquote>\n\nAnd
  the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Empire-Orson-Scott-Card/dp/0765316110/ref=sr_1_27/702-4577385-3924039?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1191740368&sr=1-27\">one
  before that</a> - it's a Red-State vs. Blue-State civil war fantasy filled with
  complaints about the divide in American politics and pro-right rhetoric.  \n\nSo..
  what's going on? Empire sucked, but at least it was stomping around in it's own
  little universe. Now I have to deal with a heartwarming tale of religious observance
  and the true meaning of Christmas in the Ender's Saga universe? I say Bah! and Bah!
  once more. \n\n"
